You know what I do is write for children, and, in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, you read in the U.S.
And I always tell people that I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or leather leather and no one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany generally is something that was fell somewhere else.
You just have to go back to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the middle school in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare class.
When I went to bleed up every week in the bathroom of the boys, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom of the room of teachers.
I was doing it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, and I ended up in San Francisco, he found a lover -- and in the years, I felt the need to start working in organizations fighting AIDS.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call from that teacher, the lady lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that of adults never come to know us.
You could <unk> to Ohio, and please bring that man that I know you've already found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to relate to you with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we got <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and we take care of her family, because it was necessary, and because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman I wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> he became a box of ashes and was put on my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked to you was made in the same way.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs true and beauty, and I'm very happy that I was talking about today a lot of this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I <unk> them to me <unk> from the water almost 60 feet, and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> on another <unk> on another <unk>
<unk> are born when they fall out of the glaciers or they break down the barriers of ice.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to engage and hold up to the end, while others can't afford more and <unk> in a <unk> passion <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated apart from them, as much as we see ourselves sometimes as humans.
But reality is the opposite.
As you melts a <unk> I'm breathing his <unk> atmosphere.
As you melts a <unk> <unk> fresh water in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
And I walk up to photograph these <unk> as if it was the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments exist in that way and will not exist in that way again.
It's not death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but one continuation of his way through the life cycle.
Part of the ice of the <unk> which I photograph is very <unk> has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I'd like to show you is a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's unlikely to really get to witness a <unk> iceberg to witness it.
Here it is.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, he starts <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk> iceberg <unk>
<unk> of the water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of your personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, each <unk> a baby.
So two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to be <unk> too much in the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about conception -- I'm not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm is joined by the X chromosome.
And in the other case, the X X of sperm is joined by the X chromosome.
Both of them <unk> and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my background and I turned on two roles.
In one of my roles work with the history of anatomy.
I'm a <unk> for training and what study in this case is the way people <unk> the anatomy -- that is, from human bodies and <unk> how the body <unk> the body <unk> what have thought about the body.
The other role that performance is an activist, as a <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features are challenging social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with twins <unk> two people within one body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with <unk> sex, individuals whose physics bonds don't fit in male <unk> and conventional <unk>
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> adopted many ways.
I'm going to give you some examples in ways of having a sex that doesn't be <unk> in the common forms or a female forms.
For example, there's the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> <unk> gene <unk> and says to the <unk> that we all have in life <unk> which is <unk>
And then, in <unk> life, the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual doesn't have on receptors in testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So there's high levels of testosterone but <unk>
As a result, the body develops in the following course of a female.
When you <unk> the baby looks like a little girl.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, but until puberty, when it's growing and developing breast breast but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is happening.
And after realizing you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has <unk> and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you might think this is a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women, as men, like men, we have something called <unk> glands
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the <unk> hormone.
Most women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman, he doesn't know her <unk> structure, I think it's a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a result, someone like me has the most exposed brain to <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> who has <unk> syndrome.
So sex is a complicated thing. It's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a certain way they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a 19-year-old and <unk> and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, and sexual relationships with her, he was wearing a life as a boy and I had just found that she had <unk> and a <unk>
He had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had the 20th of the 20th and the uterus the <unk> glands were so active that they essentially created a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, his genitals were exposed to the hormone component typically a male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> anything.
And it was at age 19, when he started having a medical problem caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, I was a woman in the inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> which is to say, they have <unk> tissue wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So there's a lot of sex.
The reason why kids with these kinds of bodies -- so that they have -- <unk> twins or <unk> they are <unk> to <unk> surgeries -- it's not to be able to get away from better physical health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason they <unk> several surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy carries <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is having a black identity -- <unk> a black man means having African anatomy in <unk> terms.
A terribly simplistic.
And when you have a body showing you something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of <unk> very romantic.
Imagine how amazing you have kids that are born like two people in the same body.
The highest recent case is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> put their sex in the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Many of them were called to ask, "What are you going to do to determine whether <unk> <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that there are no such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't plot a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and <unk> -- we draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we do the more of the science, we have to admit that these <unk> categories -- we thought they were <unk> <unk> categories that are <unk> directly with <unk> categories, are much more <unk> than <unk>
And not only in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something which is much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the fact that they were <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we moved into science we get more and more in a uncomfortable area where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that are <unk> probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our culture today, in the United States today, are the struggles at beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set out a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today <unk> not in public, but I know within the <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to get involved with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of you got a pen in front of your nose, and if he moved you still not <unk>
If you stopped moving through it.
But today, you can, for example, extract organs of a body and putting them into another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with a dilemma to determine somebody's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories could make someone like me.
In politics I'm progressive, to make people with <unk> <unk> but I have to admit that it makes me nervous.
<unk> that these categories are much more fragile than we thought I was <unk>
<unk> from the point of view of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of the <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and <unk> in what they did, that I find myself every single time looking at that musical <unk> <unk> and not by the music, which is totally <unk>
It's because of what happened in <unk> with the <unk>
The <unk> <unk> was, for me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain to them why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept.
And as all remember, what we <unk> our <unk> <unk> was the idea of the <unk> The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of the right of birth.
They had the concept of blue <unk>
They were from the idea that it was going to be able to political power by the right of blood passed off the grandfather to father and then the son, and so on.
The <unk> <unk> rejected that idea and replaced it by a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They went through the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the common anatomy and not the differences, that was a very radical thing.
And partly they were doing because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time I was doing science.
And it's very clear, if you look at the history of <unk> <unk> that many people were very interested in science and in the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> of the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of power <unk> passed out of a vague idea of birth.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look back, for example, the Declaration of <unk> they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And consequently, we were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were laid out the foundations of the future of Civil Rights
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And women <unk>
Then came the success of the Civil Rights Movement with people from <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
Again, people in color that we <unk> to <unk> <unk> and again, <unk>
We see the same with the Slow Movement of <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we need to start asking why we hold certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For instance, I don't want to give a fish the same rights than a human.
I don't want to say we should be <unk> in the anatomy.
I don't want to say that at the age of five years should be allowed to have sex or <unk>
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why to keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Let's imagine that one of them, <unk> was born three months before time: June 1, 1980.
Henry, on the contrary, was born in term: he was a March <unk> of 1980.
For the only fact that I was born three months before that Mary was attributed to every three months before Henry's the right to <unk> sexual consent, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that because it has a different biological age, but because he was born later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, in virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> by virtue of being considered a man now <unk> from the <unk> <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
<unk> on your hand, doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman only in some states.
So still <unk> categories that in many ways are <unk> and <unk>
And now the question is, what do we do now that science went both in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up science, but at the same time I feel like science will be <unk>
Where do we go from here?
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to map the line somewhere, so we're going to do it to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a rare position.
For example, Texas at some point has decided to marry a man you don't have to have chromosome, and to marry a woman you have to have <unk>
Now, in practice, they don't have examinations that are going to give people <unk>
But this is also very rare.
If you look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech "I <unk> to <unk> offers a solution.
He says we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea looks very good."
But in practice, how do you do that?
How do we judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be involved in this for <unk> rights to people, because I have to admit that I know of some <unk> <unk> that probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more <unk> intelligent decisions and <unk> about their sexual relationships than 40 I know.
So how do you put the theme of the <unk> content.
It's very difficult.
And a part of me asked what would happen if the character of one person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI <unk>
We want to really get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this thinking of thinking about the subject of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy, and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being killed -- unless you are willing to submit to sex change in whose case it allows you to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon who talked about a couple of years ago that I had made to give birth twins <unk> and then pick up the <unk>
But when the phone asked her the reason for the operation, he was a very <unk> operation, and he told me that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
What I said, "Well, he was considered political asylum.
The United States offers huge possibilities for people to be who they are without <unk> to change the state of the state.
So I think we have to be on the head.
Well, to finish the end I mean, I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about what it would be about democracy, or as it could have been, if we had more <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a <unk> which is that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> particularly if you have people thinking in a group.
For years, since I've been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in investigate sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and to operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and concerned about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was in <unk> one of my advisers who knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I was interested in <unk> as a <unk> made me <unk>
<unk> what has the <unk> of <unk>
And I thought, "It's the <unk> question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking <unk> stereotypes -- so there's nothing <unk> in the <unk>
But the more I have thought about their question, more than I think there's a little female in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the <unk> were very attentive to find the way to protect people in the state, you might have become more <unk> to this concept, perhaps we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk> <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we organize democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and think more about relationships.
So as we tried to create a more perfect <unk> think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In the year 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where it wants to go to live and work, have the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, we are far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count a single city for <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth a lot more than its building cost.
So easily we could engage the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may be absurd if you have never thought about new cities.
But just <unk> by buildings from apartments.
Imagine the half of those who wanted to live in apartments were already owners, and that to the other half would still be <unk> to do this.
You could try to increase the capacity for <unk> all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that we <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that are around them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the distraction of the construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all of those <unk>
But you could go to a completely new place, and build a completely new apartment building -- always and when the rules of that place will be <unk> the construction instead of putting it out.
So I proposed that governments were able to use new reform zones to hold cities and gave them a name for <unk> cities.
I later found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge to reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year around 75,000 <unk> will come up from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> happened by a Chinese constitutional crisis.
In the next few regular elections -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform in which we promised reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk at TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of tests with users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to its most fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of rules, like those rules that say they can't go and annoy all the current residents of apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but you need so much of technologies like rules to <unk> and usually the rules that prevent us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him to <unk> a link with the <unk>
He showed it to <unk>
They named me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities are, much more valuable than its cost.
And I used this picture that shows the value of land in a place like New York <unk> which in some cases, are worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a <unk> pause, he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk was describing in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and a choice for people to choose if they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way for our country to move forward.
He asked me to go and talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to <unk> a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that would be <unk> at least 1,000 square miles.
That's more than 100,000 acres.
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The faces of the public were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform and said, <unk> <unk> thank you so much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I'm here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice for a city that you could go to be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away from the North.
And also <unk> new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government would need help in <unk> countries could benefit from the countries that they would help them to establish and make the rules of <unk> so that everybody could trust that the <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and we saw a site.
This picture is from there.
It could take a thousand square miles.
And soon after, the 19th of January, voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional willingness to create these special regions of development.
In a country that I had just passed through this <unk> crisis in Congress in the Congress in favor of this constitutional constitutional <unk>
All the <unk> all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
To <unk> in the <unk> you have to pass two times in Congress.
On February 17 has been passed over again in another voting <unk> to one.
Immediately after voting at 24 to 24 to 24 to a <unk> shifting <unk> went to the two places in the world that are most interested in engaging in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new big center of the city that's building in Korea, it's bigger than the center of Boston.
All you see there was built in four years, after four years and getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this, this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and you're thinking about a place for the second city.
They're setting up a legal system that would allow the managers to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow its Supreme Court to be the ultimate court for this new justice system.
There are urban and builders of cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know you've already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are many businesses that wanted to move in the <unk> especially in a place with a free free zone, and there's a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately to another place.
There are a million a year coming out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family to get a job -- sometimes are mothers who have to earn money for so just eating or buy clothes.
Sadly, sometimes there are even kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it look like to think of insist on many cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> asked me to say, "Thank "Thank TED TED TED.
I'm <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a confession -- and that's that I live obsessed with the <unk>
I love to find, <unk> and more recently, to photograph and post my blog and <unk> and <unk> and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Oh, thank you.
<unk> stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I go to meet <unk> people -- usually my money goes to a good <unk> My way is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I'll be my <unk>
I would like <unk>
less than 20 dollars?
If all of the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
Coming back to my <unk> I want to tell you what I <unk> for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings to someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I brought up seven pieces of clothes, <unk> and nothing else.
<unk> interior for exactly one week is everything I've put in my <unk>
I thought I would be able to find everything else I'd like to use after I got here to Palm <unk>
And because they don't know me as the woman who walks for TED in <unk>  That means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound that interesting?
While I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I have learned in this journey of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
This is what I call this glowing tiger <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost look at it for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including <unk> <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a brilliant red red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get away from the right people -- not just <unk> you will be <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child who carry in.
Sometimes people tell me it seems to play the <unk> or I remember them in seven years.
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the key.
If you think you look good, it's almost safe you are.
And if you think you don't look good, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and outside, there is no look that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
A universal truth, six words for you: The golden <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style, and it's only a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again when people approached me this week simply by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, I was going to give it all.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that we need to leave certain things.
I don't need <unk> to these things, because at the back of the corner, there will always be another <unk> colorful suit. If there's a little love in my heart and <unk>
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split in two parts.
The left-hand side, which is the logical side, and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be a completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where do you <unk> your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> by one of these extremes, but I think for most members of this audience, their brain is something like this -- with a big <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not to be mutually exclusive.
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum physicists <unk> we need quite a lot of logic to <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a pretty intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put them playing with them and then we see as <unk> and then we developed our intuition at that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a intuition that you may have developed over the years is the one that says one thing can be only in a place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you're not born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember watching a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a small child, and he didn't do it very well, they always <unk>
But I bet the playing with that box in parking spaces, he taught him a valuable lesson, and it is that big things don't allow the <unk> to stay in place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you be a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with the parking <unk> they play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all sorts of really rare things -- like they can go through walls, or that can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all of these observations, and called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point there was the physics of a few years -- you needed of quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you don't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't often play with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not very much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit my way to my logic.
Because if it's all made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't be on the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why it didn't.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow demonstrate that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that it's been on an overlap on quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's just in the center.
And then we make a very big approach to the small metal metal <unk>
What we see is a little bit of metal, a way of springboard and a springboard and <unk> on a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip and I started to work all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this <unk> sort of swimming <unk> that is underneath the device.
This device has the ability to be on an integrated overlap but for it needs a little bit of aid.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator in an elevator -- I do all sorts of weird, but then when other people get up to do those things, because I don't want to bother you or actually <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
<unk> on <unk> objects are not just people, too, is the light that <unk> it and the wind going on to the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave like quantum mechanics, we would have to throw all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then <unk> a <unk> and we pulled all the air down, and then we <unk> it to a lower temperature of less than a degree on absolute zero.
Now, by being just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free of acting like it.
So we measure their motions.
We discovered that it was moving in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, I was vibrating. And the way I <unk> was like a breathing of this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving it a <unk> <unk> we were able to make it <unk> and not <unk> at the same time -- something that just happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing and you don't <unk> at the same time?
Let's think of the atoms.
In one case, all <unk> of atoms that make up that piece of metal are still still, and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just at certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years -- because, look at this, the differences on scale between one atom and that little bit of metal is roughly the same as the difference between that piece of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you <unk>
I mean, it's my kind of logical part of it.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be that?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it is when we got it, and we turned the lights on, and we looked inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, seemingly all the objects on the elevator are actually just quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about what you hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims everything interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more profound than that.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the profound queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something about museums and art to my boss that's here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months and <unk>
A lot of negotiations and stories were <unk> with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories from why we did.
I think my own story is explaining just to this slide, and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
I better show you the demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've been doing since its launch.
So, <unk> are we going to <unk>
Look around all the museums out there.
There's the gallery, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites, when I <unk> the art art museum in New York.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we're in the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We open the blueprint on the top, and with one click, we jump inside.
They're inside, they want to go to the end of the hall, right?
They go ahead. <unk> <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't reached the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> in <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
You see, this is one of the images.
Here is all the information <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million <unk>
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you can actually get to 10,000 million <unk>
It can zoom in in a very simple way.
You see things that are going on.
I love this guy, his expression is no price.
But if you really would want to be <unk>
So I started to play, and I found myself with something that was going on there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems <unk>
I walked in, and I found that the kids were actually playing something.
And I did a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is on hitting a <unk> with a pole on Tuesday Tuesday
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get deeper into depth and you'll see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take the image, so you see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is coming, a second.
So now we're rapidly going to jump over again at MoMA, in New York.
Here's another of my favorites, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this <unk> play.
It goes up and really what you can do it.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I'd never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite features here.
There's a lot of things over here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can online to create your own museum, create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walked in, I've created this function I call "The Power of <unk> -- we've just made a zoom in it.
This is <unk> <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, I send you to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel like contemplating these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think to me, the main thing is that all the amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they even don't come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium do justice for its artwork and which is represented online online.
And the great question that I'm doing today is, "You say, "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk> <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it a <unk> a flying <unk>
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
Let me tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian <unk> all the kids in Italy grow up with this picture on the wall of your bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that this has happened to be a very interesting thing in <unk> careers one in the last two decades.
It does some time, if you wanted to win a race of <unk> one, you would take a budget and give it to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you gain the career.
This is that, in engineering, it will be <unk> in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
What is interesting is that real-time control systems are starting to enter in our lives.
Our cities over the last few years, have been covered in networks and electronics.
They're turning computers into the open.
And as <unk> are starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As I count on, I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the <unk> population.
75 percent of the <unk> consumption of <unk> and even 80 percent of CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all of these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> at MoMA, at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, they start to <unk>
In a way, it's kind of like almost all the existing atoms in that way, they get sensors and <unk>
And that's changing the interaction that we have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like <unk> <unk> <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> he says that at the end he took the hammer and he threw it up to the Moses -- you can still see a little <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> -- that's what you don't <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> on the idea of getting the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection of the <unk>
The first project I wanted to share with you is really one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer with luck 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup <unk>
Maybe some of the remember, they played <unk> and France, and at the end of the <unk> gave the <unk>
And anyway, I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by watching the activity <unk> on the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> River.
It's the morning, before play.
The line of time is on the top.
On the afternoon, there are people over here and there are <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> in France.
<unk> people make a quick call and goes to the toilet.
Second time. End of time.
First of my time -- a second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She won Italy, yeah!
That night, they all went to <unk> the center.
There you see the big <unk>
The next day everyone went to the middle of the winning team and the Prime Minister of then.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a big party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we couldn't just do a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and consume it.
Today, we know all about the <unk> of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that are making a <unk> how it <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in their shift in the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are all <unk>
Then we put a little chip, one tag on the garbage and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
<unk>
After a week.
With this information, we realized that there are lots of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist.
They're going on complicated things, and there's a lot of no need.
But the other thing that we think is that if you look at every day that the cup that dropped not <unk> which is still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle you dropped a day is still there.
If we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us much more about detection and many other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part we talked about at first, which is <unk> on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and south Europe have a beautiful tradition of use of water in public space in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology technology, the new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop was, imagine that you have a <unk> and <unk> valves from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It creates like a curtain curtain with pixels with water.
If you fall down the pixels can write on them, show patterns, images, <unk>
And then you zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We introduced this to the mayor <unk>
She liked it.
<unk> a commission to design the entrance to the <unk>
We call it the <unk> <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no doors no windows, but when you come up and open up so you can happen.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you go down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture is lost, as in this case.
Those days will always be somebody, in the winter, when you get the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that they have <unk> it is that when almost all architecture goes away.
This is working.
You see people <unk> so it happens in the inside.
And here I am trying not to be <unk> by testing sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more funny.
All the <unk> children came to the building, because the way they interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that opens up to let me happen, but a building that was still <unk> and holes in water, and you had to jump to don't get wet.
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about how people give them to our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things for <unk> that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the <unk> the pixels of water, and of projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine if you could have little helicopters in the air and every single pixel had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, which is moving with others in synchrony.
We could form this cloud,
A flexible screen sort of like this with a flexible screen configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, where what it changes is light, not the position of <unk>
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen would appear in different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D pixels that you can zoom in, and you can see it from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like it before.
When the light turns on, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, from the movement of the people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best ballet dancers of today, the star of New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture its 3D movements and use them as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> capturing it in different <unk>
It's so <unk> 3D in real time as motion capture.
It can <unk> all the movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels -- we can play with them, with color and movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment as a <unk> environment like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everybody <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last two years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We have <unk> everything like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign, we can go through the digital world -- we can go through the digital world of power <unk> the physical world.
In our case, this might want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to look at today's challenges think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how to move from the digital world into the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, <unk>
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the actual cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but it's covered with <unk>
You can move inside, to have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, to serve to share the main moments of the 2012 Olympics.
So it's a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, like a new peak in London.
You can get into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anybody that goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are <unk>
Suppose I would tell you that with only one changes in your genes, they could improve <unk> for more accurate and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be in the best way, will be stronger to have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and sure about ourselves?
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe be from those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What else did you ask them?
What do you want, if you could choose something?
<unk> from the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people would you define creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> I probably had to be the number of people present here.
That's very good.
How many would you choose the memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Ah, most of you. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this that the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe be possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED conference but today I want to give you a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> which also <unk> in the Catholic Church -- <unk> wrote a trial called "Nothing in biology -- makes sense of <unk>
But if you actually accept biological evolution consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
Does it mean each other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well on one end, is, of course, the most interested in us.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
So there has been maybe 20 to 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We've been here about <unk> years.
It might seem to be very far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, mostly the basic machinery of our cells is roughly the same.
You realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, <unk> <unk> that comes out of <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize we all carry on in the gut more bacteria than the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> <unk> the <unk> you think of <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully <unk> environment, for those bacteria.
It's warm dark, <unk> it's very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that they can want without the effort of their part.
It's actually like a quick pathway for the bacteria with the occasional disruption of the occasional rush to the <unk>
But so on, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what do we give us the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something probably better adapted to <unk>
In this vast symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one and only <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you have <unk>
When I just <unk> college and I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and realized something fundamental -- in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms, every cell simply divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two cells <unk>
But when organisms come up together, things start to change.
It goes into a sexual reproduction.
And something very important about the emergence of sexual reproduction that passes the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, one could say that the <unk> of the body goes into evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I was like, well, <unk> <unk> death <unk> seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was going on, I had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Las Vegas well in their 90 years.
And one night, somebody hits his door door to his hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him, you find a gorgeous dancer <unk>
You look at it and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
He says, "It's <unk> says, "I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different goal to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted you to stay healthy.
I wanted to recover the health in the disease.
I wanted to live more and more in a healthier way.
Evolution is about spending the genome at the next <unk> <unk> and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary view of view, and I are like <unk> <unk> designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think everybody <unk> the feeling that <unk> Allen when he said, "I don't want to get immortality across my work.
I want to <unk> you don't know.
Evolution doesn't necessarily favors longevity.
It doesn't necessarily favors the biggest or the stronger or the faster and even the more smart.
Evolution favors the better creatures adapted to their environment.
That's the only test of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the <unk> bacteria who can survive the heat of the <unk> that would <unk> if there were fish there, fish in a void, yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution, and if we go back to think about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look ahead at the <unk> phase -- I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the reasoning behind it would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and <unk> of the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we <unk> so much that it is no longer possible to have the isolation of evolution.
A second possibility is that we have a traditional kind of evolution of the traditional kind of natural species, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would argue that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of <unk> when as a species -- <unk> distant planets are going to be the isolation and environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there's a third possibility, an <unk> intriguing and frightening.
I call this <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and <unk> by us as individuals in the decisions that we make.
Now, how could it happen?
How could we get to do this?
Let's first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, they're making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what you choose at the individual and family level.
Just think that if you could be able to choose not only sex in your <unk> but in your own body to make the genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate <unk>
You don't want to make those changes in your <unk>
If you look at the future that kind of changes will be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project began in 1990 and sued 13 years old.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year of being done, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the 3,000 billion base pairs from the human genome to a cost that is at about 20,000 and a week.
It didn't make a lot of <unk> so that the human genome is going to be made by <unk> and getting more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more <unk>
These changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, they are going to induce <unk>
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in the course of the vaccine against <unk> <unk> cells from a plant plant plants.
Can you imagine a good thing that comes out of the <unk>
That's reality today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine then only two little <unk>
They can change the cells from their bodies, but if you could change the cells from their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the <unk> <unk> and give your children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminating diabetes, eliminating <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want any more <unk>
And then, that same technology <unk> that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases that are going to allow us to also adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't we have the ingenuity of <unk> Ken <unk> especially if you could do it with the next generation of the <unk> machine.
Why don't you have a <unk> muscle to allow us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions of passing this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have become the evolution of before in <unk>
We're going to take a process that would normally take 100,000 years and we can rotate it at 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are elections that their grandchildren, or grandkids of their grandchildren, are going to have them.
We're going to use these options on an attempt for a better society, more successful, more successful.
Or, let's selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us, but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that's more boring and more <unk> and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deeper of all: we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for bad, and before what you might <unk> these options are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet high.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a single seat that day. He was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to you with flight <unk>
So immediately he looked at them, and they said, "No problem. I probably <unk> some <unk>
The pilot had left the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the plane with the Hudson River.
That's not the road.
We <unk> the engines.
Imagine being on an airplane and without <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three words have ever heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the <unk>
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before I died, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get in, and I didn't did, all the fences that I wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that further, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the guy is ready and the person is there, I'm going to set it up.
I don't want to do anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, has changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as I <unk> the George Washington bridge that wasn't for a lot -- I thought about, <unk> I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve all I did.
But in my humanity, I also give my ego.
And I'm sorry about the time that I <unk> in things that didn't care about people who care matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as <unk> in that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels <unk>
I'm not trying to have <unk> <unk> <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental clock is going to be <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the <unk> water.
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to break up in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, <unk> die isn't fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness <unk> in one thought, which is, I just want one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- the first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> as a kid.
And for me, that was the whole reason to be in the world.
And at that point, I got to connect these two points, which is the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For most of all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I was awarded a miracle, not to die that day.
And I was awarded another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and come back and live in another way.
You who are flying today, the challenge you can imagine that the same happens in your plane -- and please not be -- but imagine, and how do you <unk>
What are you saying to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How would you change their relationships and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents to <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been blessed in life with many projects.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he came to her home after running and said, "Dad, I feel like <unk> <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today <unk> has complete <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design company, and so that of course graffiti is something <unk> that we admire and <unk> in the art world.
So we decided we were going to <unk> to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with his brother and her father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to speak with Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he can be able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be an important one, and you have a very good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Anybody see the movie "The <unk> and <unk>
They communicate in that way they do <unk>
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I presented with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of a check that I didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
I engaged with his brother and her father there at that very moment, "All right, this is the <unk> Tony going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to do her art again.
Because it's <unk> that someone who have both in their inner can't be <unk>
So I spoke at a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> Research <unk> who have a technology that allows them to project light on any surface and then with a laser pointer that's about that and the negative space is negative.
So they're going around doing art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
First of you start with sex organs, then with the bad words, then with the Bush attacks, and in the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a life cycle in your <unk>
And so the journey began.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of this organization and a lot of moving things from one side we had achieved a couple of things.
One, we played the gates of the insurance companies and we got a machine so that they could <unk> could make a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when I talk to you with the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy's <unk>
The other thing we did was bringing seven programmers from all the <unk> world from every single corner of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved to the garage behind and these hackers and programmers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took the control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we were doing something completely stupid and that when he would have removed the frames from the walls and her place would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to the <unk> walk of <unk> my son was part of my dog, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
It's a pair of cheap sun, we bought in the <unk> walk of <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> <unk> and Radio <unk>
We take a camera <unk> we put it into a light light, and now there's a device that is free -- and it builds yourself, we publish the code <unk> the software goes down to free.
And we created a device that doesn't have limitation at all.
There is no insurance company to say.
There is no hospital that can say <unk>
Anyone with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using only your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this picture is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of planning on all night, Tony returned back to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful photo because this is the support system of your life and looking through the support system.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot outside the hospital.
And he went back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine, what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to bust into the parking lot, so we felt like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this, he sent us an email and this was what was saying, "This was the first time I drew in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and somebody came to me to come up and get me out there so I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our <unk>
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk> Blank.
Someone with this artistic potential deserves much more.
So we're trying to figure out how to do it and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all sorts of recognition.
We've won a lot of prizes.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are doing money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
<unk> were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized as one of the 50 greatest inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what ends up closing the <unk> is that in April of this year in <unk> <unk> in the downtown Los Angeles is going to be an exhibit called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you look at something that is not possible, it possible.
Nothing that we have in this room was possible -- the stage, the microphone, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a certain moment.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> <unk> technology -- I just recognized something and I was obsessed with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do every day when we find something that we feel like to do. If it's not right now, when? And if I'm not me, you are."
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years <unk> in such a very difficult situation and at the same time so much dangerous time.
I went to the tough <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
<unk> in <unk> and dangerous areas.
And I spent 30 days -- a lot of fun -- a lot of fun in the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I've been <unk> in situations in horrible appearance, with the only goal to treat.
So when I knew I would come here to make a TEDTalk on the world of brands and the <unk> I wanted to do something a little different.
So some of you may have heard, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some text messages on Facebook, some of Twitter, I offered to sell the rights of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What was the following: I <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it comes and according to content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it into <unk> to you or your company to do it.
But I said this is a very good opportunity to <unk>
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a headline in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone would buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago I couldn't help him for certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the <unk> world of <unk>
And as I said before, I was in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be <unk> for something as difficult or so dangerous to go into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that is about the <unk> of products, marketing and advertising, and that all the film would be <unk> with <unk> of marketing and marketing and <unk>
The movie is going to call "The <unk> <unk>
What happens in "The largest <unk> <unk> is that all of the top at the bottom, at the beginning of the end, has images of brand, all the time; from the <unk> which appears to appear before the title of the title, which is the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> in the film <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea, <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is it <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk>
He was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of brand X in the title, but we're going to make sure that we put all the categories into the film.
Maybe you <unk> a shoe and it becomes the most brilliant shoe that you <unk>
The greatest car you have <unk> in "The largest <unk> <unk> than <unk> <unk> from "The largest <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing the brands as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film is full of transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this film.
That's the full idea everything film film to end.
And I would love to help you help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> I don't know how responsive is going to be the people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> No <unk>
MS: A million and a half million <unk> <unk> <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard to get the meeting with them, but it's certainly worth convincing a couple of big brands here.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment to leave the movie -- let's look at it like a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be <unk>
MS: But it's going to be hard to <unk> the film or to be I?
JK: And so on.
MS: <unk> means you're not very optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where he go. <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: I thought we <unk> the <unk> meant we have a conversation.
<unk> the camera means we don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
None wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to introduce the product to so many people as possible, and as many people would see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of the separate media -- is not the idea to tell that new vehicle that is going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a mistake of <unk> and that mistake was this.
Actually, no, there was not such a mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for <unk> images on Google <unk>   This is one of the first pictures that are <unk>
I like your <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices -- being the last line perhaps the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> President <unk> even <unk> <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to it, something changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency day <unk>  like that weird bear that still follows <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird <unk>
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and tell you that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want you to <unk> <unk> history.
We want you to make a story, but that <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would love me in some lie -- and that's him looking like <unk> said, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
Is your story, it's my story, and it's the <unk> story.
As you can see, we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, an agency, wanting to help me -- and that just because I met John Bond and Richard <unk> of a lot of years -- I realized I would have to go on my own, I would have to take the <unk> and go to companies myself with all my team.
So what I started to see is a sudden -- which I started to <unk> is that when you start talking to business the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends that make big, enormous, enormous, giants and others that make small, independent movies like mine.
And my friends who make movies of big Hollywood movies -- they say that the reason their movies are so successful is because of the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these large, giant movies of <unk>
And the movie is called "The largest <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> at the film?
Every time I'm coming out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any point during an interview with someone I can say, "Are you good for this <unk>
You're ready? You see you a little nervous.
I want you to help you get <unk>
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there you offer one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have too much to man like a solid, to <unk> to <unk> <unk>
That's the general picture.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at <unk>
Karen <unk> We're a small brand.
<unk> the kind of smaller movies that we <unk> are more well a <unk> <unk>
So we don't have the budget of other brands.
So doing things like that, you know, remind me to remind people is the reason why this is interested.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Volunteer: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something <unk> <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category on positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It keeps it <unk>
How do you keep you fresh over time? With better <unk> more <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those who <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What are there from a common kind of <unk>
I need to talk to the man on the street, people like me, to the ordinary <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good <unk>
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what's the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of the dark colors. Many gray and things like that.
Usually I'm wearing a sunglasses, and I like the crystals and the same thing.
Woman: If you were a brand a brand might be a <unk> <unk> Mercedes <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I'd call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In a <unk> part of a <unk> part of <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the guy.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx FedEx out of FedEx because he <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: Nation <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be <unk> Tom, but I often <unk> at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could get into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that <unk> personality.
If you could do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a family photograph.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings of your way to be.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me of that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world in which we are <unk> like people around you, your family, your family, the way your life, the work you do.
All of those things come from, and they start in a place and in my case come and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk about.
MS: The next is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I want to be me.
I like different things.
I like <unk> I like <unk>
A: Tell me about <unk> to what do you do that?
What is the <unk> What a <unk> phase is now?
Why is it important to <unk> What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
<unk> more of you, not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be honest about what kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.)
A: Thank you for your <unk> Big <unk> A: <unk> <unk> Thank you very much.) OK.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what you're going to get out of this.
There was a lot of <unk> on all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> in your personality, <unk> the brand Morgan <unk> <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They got very good together.
And I think there's almost one paradox in them.
And I think some companies just <unk> in one of their strong strengths or the other instead of focusing on both.
Many companies tend to avoid the things that are not <unk> they avoid fear, those items, and you actually give them to accommodate and make it become positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands do you do?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are markings of <unk> and <unk> <unk> those things that have gone and come but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: <unk> <unk> What's your <unk>
If somebody asks you to give you your brand, your brand, your brand, your brand, what would be?
You're a <unk> <unk> You're somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you a more good attribute of <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
The attributes of <unk> are kind of playful to be cool as <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> <unk> or bold as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> magical or mystic <unk>
Or are you more <unk> <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
You're a traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're <unk> stable, <unk> safe, <unk> <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this movie we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they would have no control over the final product.
We allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how they now use MRI to identify the centers of desire in the brain both for commercial marketing as a movie.
We went to San Paulo where they have banned advertising in the air.
In the entire city over the last five years, there's no <unk> there is no <unk> there is no <unk>
And we went to school districts that companies are getting together in the schools with problems in the U.S. problems.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects that I have had the biggest answer or the ones I've been most successful in those that I interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
He <unk> the <unk> took off their agencies, and they said, maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that's going to make people think about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how does it gone? They succeed?
Well, since the movie was released in the <unk> Festival let's take a look.
According to <unk> the movie was coming out in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press, no TV.
The movie is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already started to win lead.
And it's not wrong because most of the agencies that we talk to talk to their clients not being part.
I have always believed that if you take risks, that in those risks are opportunities.
I think when you get to people that's pushing the failure.
I think that when you train their employees on the loss of risk is preparing their company to be able to have a <unk>
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people that are not afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, we'll move forward, I think we have to give it a place to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear <unk> the risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace risk.
And ultimately, we have to keep transparency.
Today more than a little bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all of my talk <unk> <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who by <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> introduces <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So -- so, <unk> on the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a remarkable question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the TED graph, the Foundation, a check for <unk> to be applied to my support for TED <unk>
The idea behind the computer worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant in <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we can compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use software <unk> they're a completely different technology.
But if we could put a cash cash virus in a laptop used by an engineer to set up this gray, gray, so we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray, <unk> <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
Is it easy, yeah?
I want to tell you how we find this.
When we started to research on <unk> about six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex at the <unk> part of the <unk> I used multiple <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> <unk> these control systems.
That struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where we infect our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened to this.
So things are very strange.
<unk> <unk> <unk> as a laboratory in the lab that didn't like our <unk> <unk> it, but I didn't want to eat.
I didn't make sense for me.
And after I experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking at actively looking at the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect is actually working on that <unk>
If not, <unk> doesn't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
Could it be, let's say a power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than <unk> the goal soon.
And so we pulled out and <unk> the attack, and we found that I was <unk> in two <unk> <unk> a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were armed with very professionally <unk> by people who obviously had all the internal information.
<unk> all the points to attack.
You probably even know how much we did the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you have heard that <unk> <unk> is complex, high technology, let me tell you the payload is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of the attack.
We're talking about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks like the old <unk> language.
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking at was called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
We then were looking for <unk> and data structures and we tried to engage with the real world, with potential targets of the real world.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a valuable, and it's surely located in Iran, because it's where most of the infections has been <unk>
They don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the <unk> plant.
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I consulted them in an effort to <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we could associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
<unk> is that cell phone inside the <unk> that black object that you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> you can certainly <unk> and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to go back to <unk> engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to figure out human <unk> looking very closely at the data and its structures.
So for example, the number <unk> shows up in that code, you can't <unk>
I started studying scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and I found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That makes sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
<unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
And this gave us a lot of confidence to understand what we had in my hands.
And so it wasn't <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been behind several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> on dead ends, and we had to go back again.
And yet, we discovered that both digital <unk> would point to one and the same goal, but from different perspectives.
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and it's going to turn these <unk> and <unk> and <unk> it communicates with six <unk> and manipulating it.
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry that other goals are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw, I really <unk>
There's the gray, gray, and the top box you see the <unk>
What this thing is doing is <unk> the input values of sensors for example, of pressure sensors, and the vibration sensors and provides <unk> code which is still running during the attack with false <unk> data.
And believe it or not, this fake <unk> data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds on <unk> video.
It's cool <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security.
We need digital safety systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a power plant, when the big steam turbine goes off, you have to open escape valves.
Obviously, this can't make a human operator here.
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then you can go through bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And neither <unk> or the security system is <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could be also, for example, in a power plant, or a car plant.
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that disseminate this burden with a <unk> key as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology <unk> to <unk>
<unk> the most possible.
And if you do that, with what you <unk> it is a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of goals are not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large numbers of targets.
We need to deal with the implications, and better than we start doing now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public on many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My guess is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the superpower, <unk>
There's one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in other ways, our problems would be even greater.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be <unk> and then I give you <unk> skills or another thing that makes users of chairs of wheelchair will get up and go walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
It's nothing different from something you put in the morning, gives you a big force, which is also increasing its speed, and help you, for example, how to handle the balance.
It's actually the true integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect with the universe and other things that are <unk>
This is not an idea of <unk>
To show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, you have to take on their back a <unk> charge of <unk> and it's <unk>
Obviously, this leads to some major complications injuries on the back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage, on my back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help drive the whole thing.
Let me introduce you to <unk> or <unk> <unk> Human <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton exoskeleton -- I can rotate it by 90 pounds of variables for many hours.
Their flexible design allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and run with great <unk>
I want to do what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then you raise my strength and my <unk>
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device this new <unk> this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back to the users of the wheels, about what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people in the wheels, in the wheels, all over the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens often very young people, with damage in the column that when they start their life -- to the 20, 30 or 40 years -- <unk> against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We also talk about the population that <unk> very quickly.
Their only option, a lot of times -- by a brain injury, or some other <unk> -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been this for the last 500 years, from its successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who 19 years ago, had a injury in the <unk> column, and as a result, he couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda using our <unk> that <unk>
It's got sensors -- it's got sensors ...
It's completely not <unk> in the crutches and send signals to the board on board, here on the back.
There are a little bit of batteries that give it energy into the motors in the <unk> and at the knees, and make it progress with this soft and very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 years at the top of my life, when, for a strange leap in the air, skiing down to the bottom of it.
On a second, I lost all feeling and everything from <unk> down.
Shortly after that, a doctor went into my room in the hospital, and he said, "You will never come back to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole to the last ounce of hope from my being.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs to scale rocks and even riding a bicycle <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not only of soldiers, but Amanda, and all the users of chairs with the wheels, everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I've just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> they practice sex to say hello, and play is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> Man or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet his cousins.
This is the world of the wild Bonobos in the rainforests of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with the chimpanzees, their closest lives.
That means we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, the chimps are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made a lot of emphasis on this in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by large, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society where violence hasn't yet observed.
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the rainforest and it's been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario that has been <unk> for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction is also <unk> the survival of the Bonobo.
The commercial meat trade and deforestation can be unable to fill in a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear the laughter hidden <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as apes <unk> love, not <unk> because they have sex and frequent <unk> and <unk> to manage conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love to play throughout their entire life.
Play is not just a <unk>
For us and for us, the game is fundamental to a set of links and foster <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
<unk> increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game Bonobos to look at the roots of the same laughter, the dance and the human ritual and the human <unk>
The game is the glue that come together.
I don't know how to play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I don't talk about football.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "I have <unk> <unk>
I just believe that in this case he love, right?
Yeah.
So sexual play is common in bonobos as in humans.
And this video really is interesting because <unk> this video really is interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into the game, like the <unk> and also how the game requires trust, and <unk> <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take a lot of forms, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female -- who is playing with <unk> water.
I think that like that, sometimes we played by ourselves, and we explore the limits of our inner inner worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a world more and more difficult to greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these abilities.
In other words, play is our <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But <unk> our <unk>
The game is not <unk>
<unk> is critical.
For bonobos and humans alike, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks at least appropriate play, you can be the moments in which it's the most <unk>
So with primates, we embrace this gift of evolution and <unk> together while they <unk> creativity, friendship and friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for the development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty, <unk> fires as a captain <unk> in a <unk>
And in our city, where volunteers are going to have a highly skilled <unk> you have to get to the fire site very soon to enter action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer in the site, so I had a very high probability to go.
But there was still a career standing against the other volunteers to get the captain to the captain and find out what our task was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that has certainly gone through one of the worst days of his life.
We were in full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in her pajamas and <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got before I was, <unk> <unk> <unk>  He came first to the captain and he asked him to go on and would save the dog owner <unk>
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> lawyer who, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell people that I entered a <unk> building to save a live living because I won it for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need you to go home.
I need you to <unk> <unk> the fire, and I'm bringing this woman a couple of <unk>
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I hoped but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, and I went to the firemen and I went to the firemen who were more or less had ended up in the fire and walked into the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my payload back down the staircase where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door.
We got out of the house, the treasures for house owner where, like they would expect, they got much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later the department received a letter from the house owner by the brave effort to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at over was someone had reached a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling as a volunteer fireman is witnessing acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of acts of grace and courage at the individual level.
And you know what have I learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have succeeded, or they're out of <unk> remarkable levels, I'd like to remind you to remind you.
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give you a little bit of <unk>
<unk> food in a dining room, a <unk> park.
They're mentors.
Not every day, we're going to have the opportunity to save somebody's life, but every day we're going to influence somebody's life.
So I trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete <unk>
The first blocks of concrete was built in <unk> with a very simple idea, modules of a cement that fit into each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used building unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build larger things than us, like buildings or bridges -- a brick at once.
So essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, <unk> came up with this.
It was called <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came to every home.
It's been estimated that over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful buildings or <unk>
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the block of concrete in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the German labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a aesthetic brick world piled stacked to each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the block of concrete, the transistor allows you to create much greater circuits and more complex, a brick at once.
But there's a <unk> difference. The transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't know what the building blocks of our time are reserved for experts, so I decided to change it.
About eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started exploring the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they come together with magnets.
So you can't put it in the wrong way.
The bricks have a color code.
The green is the stream, the blue is the stream, the pink input and the orange color is <unk>
So you just have to assemble one blue one with a green one, and very quickly you can start to make bigger circuits.
One blue one with one green is making light.
We can put a button in the middle and we have a <unk>
If we change the button on a module module that's here, and now we have a <unk> light.
<unk> this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to <unk> connect and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using <unk> gestures very simple.
In order to make <unk> faster or slower, just a button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increasing collection.
We want all the interactions in the world to move to bricks and ready to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We've given the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how you start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how a <unk> light works, or why the door of an elevator gets open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to the design schools.
So for example, the designers without any electronic experience begin to play with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk> --  A few weeks ago we took <unk> to the <unk> of Rhode Island School of Rhode Island, that they don't have any experience in engineering, just wood and paper and we said, "Give them something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, a <unk> <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk> which is afraid of darkness.
For these don't engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be the scope of everyone.
So <unk> has open source.
You can see the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a <unk> world inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world is ours.
So let's go ahead and make things.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is seeking to engage with the environment focusing on the <unk>
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can continue better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
<unk> is ...
Oh, I've already looked at the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple years ago, I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that's supposed to <unk> we asked them to work on government.
The initiative called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like a Peace <unk>
We <unk> some members every year and put them working with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to Third World we send them into the wild world.
They worked with great <unk> they worked with employees <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> <unk>
It's a <unk> in the city of Boston.
Here it appears as if you look at a quote, but what you really look for is that somebody is <unk> when he gets caught by snow, because he knows it's not really good at turning out fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it get to ask help in this way so <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that point, it was very much last year.
They realized that the city had never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> noticed something else: that the citizens <unk> with shovels the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did as any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can adopt a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case he got <unk>
If you don't, somebody can be <unk>
So it has a piece of playground.
It's a modest app.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 applications that are <unk> last year.
But it does something that no other <unk> government technology.
And it spreads <unk>
A responsible for <unk> systems, when we saw this app realized that he could use it, not for snow, but for citizens to accept <unk>
It's very important that these <unk> <unk> but people are <unk>
That's why you ask citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens of the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just launched it to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know nine cities that plan using it.
And this has spread completely <unk> in organic and natural ways.
If you know a bit of government technology, you know that this doesn't normally happen.
The acquisition of software typically takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that in the normal channels would have taken at least two and cost about two million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
Now there's a project in the power judicial power that the time has gone down two million dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that shows a couple of days and it spreads in viral shape is a kind of <unk> warning to the institution of the government.
It suggests the government better ways to work on, not as in private companies, as many people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but rather as the Internet itself.
I mean, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the question of the government that has new <unk> not as a problem of an institution <unk> but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out we're really good at the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools to work together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country that contribute to applications that are contributing to applications -- every day in their own communities.
They haven't been given to the government.
Do you feel a huge frustration to that, but they don't <unk> it <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost of view.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that they lay crazy and government is, in essence, in words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because we alone didn't know.
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to ask them to do it, because things are changing.
Politics is not <unk> the government itself.
And because the government ultimately made up of us -- remember that from <unk> the <unk> The way to think about it will affect the way that change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to pick people out of people who were <unk>
Well, after two years, I have come to the conclusion that the government is, especially all of the matter of <unk>
This is the center of mobile care and information.
It's the place that calls calls if you make <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> This call.
He checked into the official knowledge base.
I didn't find anything. He started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, and put it very strong and see if you <unk>
And it worked. So well for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has a <unk> and mobile app called <unk> <unk>
We don't <unk> that application.
It was the work of very clever people in the Bureau of New <unk> <unk>
One day, this happened really, comes to this <unk> <unk> in my bucket <unk> I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do to <unk>
The dynamic of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> it's all public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I walk into the place, I found the garbage garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yes. Yes. Yes.
I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical.
And it's also a great example of the government income to <unk> voluntary collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to join and help others.
So a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
I connected two people.
And it could be connected to the government services of necessary but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper alternative than the government services.
When a neighbor helps each other, <unk> the communities.
If we call the animal control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people understand it, but you think it's the input from the other.
That our entry to the government system is a vote.
How many times have we chosen to have a <unk> <unk> Sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then hope that the government will <unk> our values and <unk> our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface of 15 feet.
So below is what we call <unk>
And we say that word very contempt.
But it is that <unk> what it holds us out of that is that we've funded as something that operates in our condition, that other thing, and in consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is <unk>
If we want this institution to work, we will have to make the bureaucracy that <unk>
Because it's where the real job works.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
You've got them <unk>
It's a group of citizens worried that they have written a very detailed report of <unk> pages in response to the request of <unk> <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's activism <unk>
And for the ones that we have faced with government, it's time to ask us what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really believe that we will go where we need to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of all?
We can't do with government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the governance function so that it can expand <unk> to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so difficult to act <unk> you only have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The age of the age of members is 28 years old, so I am, I am a bigger generation than many of them.
This is a generation that's grown up taking the word and giving that almost to granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who's going to <unk> they're all going to talk.
They can express your opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when you face the government problem you don't really care about to hear their voices.
They're using your hands.
They bring them to the work to program applications that make a better job better for government.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be <unk> a <unk> out of <unk> <unk> dumping a garbage <unk> which has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we could always have <unk> those fire hydrants and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we are not only consumers, we are not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't make the citizen anymore.
So I want to ask everybody here, when it comes to the important things that we need to do together, all together, we will be a crowd of voices, or we'll also be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in jails and the death row.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED looking at and hearing these <unk> <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are told here is impact around the world.
In occasion, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have otherwise.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we've seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can have a lot of sense, but if they teach themselves with feeling, they can have a special meaning of it.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> you can get much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of the right, my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional African-American family dominated by a <unk> that was my grandmother.
It was tough -- it was strong, she had power.
It was the last word in every single discussion in the family.
She <unk> a lot of <unk> in our home.
He was a daughter of people who had been <unk>
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery -- the way the world looked like.
She was tough but it was also <unk>
When I was a little and looked at it, she went up to me and I was approaching a good <unk>
I was so hard that I could barely breathe and then <unk> me.
One or two hours later, I came back to <unk> and she said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I said no, I <unk> it again and if I told him yes, I was left in peace.
I had this human quality that would always want to be near it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the youngest of 10.
In occasion, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture her time and her attention.
My cousins were running all over the place.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
I first thought it was a game.
So I looked at it and I smile, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up across the room, and he took me out of my hand, and he said, "Come on, <unk> The two of us are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I will never forget it.
He took me out and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say to <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> <unk> I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And I said, "I think you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do it."
I will never forget it.
Then he said to me, "Just do I want you to <unk> three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to tell me, is that you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I <unk> my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so I <unk>
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to tell me, is that you will always do the right thing, but the right thing is to do it.
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
Then, finally he said, "The third thing I want you to tell me is that you never <unk> <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so I <unk>
I grew up in the field, in rural <unk> I have a brother a year and a sister a year.
When I was 14 or 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> took my sister and went to me, and we went for the forest.
We are just making the <unk> of the usual <unk>
He took a sip of beer, he gave my sister, she took a little and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right. You <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> <unk> And you always do the same as we do.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good, you can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's wrong with you, take a <unk>
And I showed me the <unk> and <unk> "Oh, not that you're thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something in front of you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this was <unk>
But I'm 52 years old, and I can admit that I've never had a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this to be a <unk> I mean by the power that the identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to others that really don't see sense.
We can't get to do things that don't think we can do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been inmate during the <unk>
My uncles died of age-related disease?
And these were the things that, according to it, we should be <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different from what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
Today is 2.3 million.
In America we have the largest <unk> rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass incarceration, in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities or black, you find so much <unk> so much despair, by these facts.
One out of three black men between the 18 and the 30 years is in jail or parole.
In urban <unk> all over the country, Los Angeles, in Baltimore Philadelphia, Baltimore to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 percent of all the young people in the prison.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that is much better about whether you're rich and <unk> than if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> it's wealth that affects the results.
And it seems to us very <unk>
The politics of fear and <unk> make us believe that these are not a problem of ours.
We're <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work with some very curious developments in our work.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you care about protection for always if you have an criminal <unk>
Right now, in Alabama, the <unk> of the black male population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we put it into the next 10 years, the level of the loss of rights is going to be so high as it was before I <unk> the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where he was taken from 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country prison for kids, without a chance of leaving ever.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people in death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In some sense, we have to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by <unk> but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in the United States is defined by mistake.
Of each nine people <unk> has identified one which is innocent who is <unk> and liberated from death row.
An innocent rate of error, <unk> an innocent <unk>
This is interesting.
In aviation you would not be allowed to fly planes if we were nine to <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we make the kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about <unk> <unk> I talk about slavery today.
I'm talking about terrorism, the age that started at the end of the rebuilding and went to the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was an defined time by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what he defined his lives.
Now there are people who come up to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teach lectures, <unk> <unk> to the people who stop saying that in our history, we deal with the first time with terrorism, after <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on with <unk> <unk> and decades of <unk> racial and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All the time we had one another.
We create tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage us with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that you couldn't overcome <unk> <unk> without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving lectures on death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know it's pretty disturbing to listen to what you <unk>
<unk> We don't have death penalty in Germany.
We can never be able to be here."
The room was quiet and a lady said, "There is no way that with our history, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational than we <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> about this.
How do we focus on a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We couldn't afford it?
It would be irrational.
And still, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If you really don't really care about these difficult issues, the positive and wonderful things they are, though, <unk>
We love innovation.
And we're fascinated by technology.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
In my mind, you need to integrate both of these things.
We talked about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more commitment, more engagement, the most basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking about and talking about the poor, the ones that never come to TED.
So thinking about them is, in a way, something that's within our being.
It's true that we need to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so committed to intellectual <unk>
<unk> with innovation, development comes not just from brain ideas.
These things come from ideas of ideas as well as the <unk>
This connection connection connection to heart is what drives us not just in the bright and <unk> but also in the dark and hard.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in Eastern Europe, suffering from <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, guidance for spirit, a willingness to be in places of despair and to be <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much in the heart of what I believe, that even in communities like TED, you should have <unk>
There is no disconnect related to technology and design, that allows us to be truly humans if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to warn you, these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we know these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer -- to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were just brought to talk to me.
Occasionally, the lady was called me to go, <unk> comes Mrs. <unk> We're going to bring together to talk.
You want to come and <unk>
I said, "I know lady. I know <unk>
So she said, "Well what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read him <unk>
So I went and just the <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was sitting there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. <unk> went to me and said, "Now, <unk> tell me that this idea of fairness justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been doomed <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end the sentences for life, without freedom.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in prison.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave her all my best speech and I looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that moment, Ms. <unk> got me on the face of the face and said, "It's why you have to be very <unk> but very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to figure out how to deal with those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because eventually humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been <unk> in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that each one of us is higher at the worst that we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to, not that it's a <unk>
Even if somebody kills the other, it's not a <unk>
This is why I think there's a basic dignity of people who have to be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and, surely, in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's why it isn't.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think even though it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> -- you don't judge ourselves for our technology, by our designs, not by our intellectual capacity or rational.
By the end it was <unk> the character of a society, not the way they treat the rich and powerful <unk> but by the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to finish with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> <unk> like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas are going beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my <unk> clients and 14 years old, which have been <unk> so that they were passionate about adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn to someone who isn't it?
The judge was <unk> as an adult, but I see a kid.
A very late night I was awake in <unk> God, if the judge can turn you into something that you're not, must have magic powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magic powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> customer <unk>
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> so that my 14-year-old client in 14 years is treated as a <unk> <unk> white, CEO of a <unk>
In the <unk> I put there that there have been <unk> behavior, in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics itself.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not only had it <unk> but he had been sent to court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And I finally <unk> Oh my God, I have to go to the court for this stupid case.
I got into the car, and I felt really <unk> <unk>
I went in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
Finally I fell out of the car, I walked into court.
I was going up the stairs when I met a black man <unk> was the <unk> of court.
When I saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's you <unk> I told you yes.
So I got <unk> and I was <unk>
And I was <unk> in my ear, <unk>
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That connected to my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the <unk>
When I arrived, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "I know Mr. <unk> And we started <unk>
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one who had written these crazy crazy things.
The cops the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people, all furious because we talked about races, because we were talking about poverty, because we were talking about inequality.
With the eye of the eye I scaled up looking at the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I would look out the window and let me hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black, with a face of concern, I entered the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> assistant was upset because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant <unk> on the old black <unk>
And he said, "What do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black man stood up, looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and he said, <unk> this little school room to tell this young person who would keep his view on the goal with <unk>
I have come to TED today because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
We cannot be truly human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of us who share this, I just want to tell you how to keep your eye on the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire in the audience, of this community, to help in your <unk> of doing something.
Something that isn't a <unk> What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities close to you.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which you're going to do an effort to <unk> the funding that you spend today in <unk> policies.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row in the next five years, a billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the murder cases not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes do not get there.
Here's an opportunity for change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these funds to get the law to get the law of security.
I think there's a very <unk> opportunity.
CA: There have been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the reason is it says it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to what you think is this?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not by crimes with violence.
It's because of the wrong drug war.
That's why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people down to the <unk> to steal a bicycle, by stealing a bicycle, by the property, rather than making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of the <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment doesn't do anything for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> I've been excited about <unk> here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months, <unk> could be the last six days or the last six days.
The idea is that the media would rather be <unk> negative news because our minds are paying attention to.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every single second of every day, our senses get a lot more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing matters more than survival, the first stop of all of this data is an old snippet of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early detection, <unk> <unk>
<unk> and recorded all the information for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So from a <unk> of <unk> stories to look at the <unk>
That old saying of the <unk> "If there's blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all digital devices give us positive news for the seven days of negative news about seven days a week, 24 hours a day, no wonder we're <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going wrong in the worse.
But it probably won't.
Maybe, instead, what happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps the huge progress done in the last century for a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying we don't have our good issues that we don't have our problems, climate change, the scarcity of water and <unk> we certainly have them.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and the long time, we ended up with them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> income per capita income through inflation has been <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has shrunk 10 times.
Moreover, the cost of food, in electricity, of transportation and communications, has dropped 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles wished that the global literacy went from 25 percent to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We are actually living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people forget.
And we keep <unk> more and higher expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, a lot of the people living under the line of poverty have electricity, <unk> <unk> television, <unk> air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> of the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
<unk> a lot of this is technology and lately, this exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the price performance of about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First, how soft it is -- in good and bad and bad times, in war and peace in recession, in depression and <unk>
This is how fast computers used to build faster.
It doesn't stop at any of the big challenges.
And although it's <unk> on a law on the left, the curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is itself faster and faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
<unk> computer that my friends from Autodesk call computational computing, sensors and networks, and networks, the 3D printing and its ability to democratize and distribute personalized production across the planet -- the synthetic biology, the fuels and the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> and the A.I. and the A.I. and the A.I. and the A.I. and the A.I. and the A.I. and the A.I. and the
I mean, how many of you saw the victory on "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was spade.
I looked at the newspapers the best headline to <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
<unk> with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everyone in your phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service, that it can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact a life of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, I would have a absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already been done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for each of the planet, it's about creating a life of the possible.
It's about taking that to be <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, the scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
Let me give you an example.
It's a <unk> story of the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
He <unk> the king of <unk>
The <unk> <unk> ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with <unk>
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, it was worth more than gold and <unk>
That's why the tip of the Washington Washington is <unk>
You see, although aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as metal <unk>
It's tied up by oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made the aluminum thing so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
We <unk> this analogy to the future.
Let's think about the energy <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet <unk> by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to Earth 16 <unk> of energy every <unk> minutes.
It's not about <unk> but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power fell 50 last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to the 15 cents of the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about the wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed at the Voyager spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, after I spent <unk>
<unk> a <unk> <unk> How do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent by water.
Yes, <unk> is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fought for the <unk> of water on the planet, but there is a hope.
It's an available technology not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
This comes from nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> her technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> -- it's the size of a small body.
It's able to generate a thousand gallons of water on the day of any source of <unk> saltwater, water, <unk> water, a <unk> for less than two cents the gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola just thought that I'm going to do a major test for hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence that that will be, Coca-Cola actually implement the <unk> in <unk> countries.
This is an <unk> innovation because of this technology that today exists.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
Oh my God, we're going to get to the 70 percent penetration of the mobile phones in the end of 2013.
<unk> that <unk> warrior has better mobile phones in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan 25 years ago.
And from having a smartphone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that no one could have happened.
So better than you and I paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars <unk> video -- video libraries of books and music, <unk> technology -- now <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe you get the best to get into the health care applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world to <unk> these technologies into a mobile device that you talk, and because it has <unk> you can get <unk> you can get out of your <unk>
To win has to make better diagnostics that a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this device <unk> a RNA virus or DNA <unk> that doesn't <unk> call the health care and, first of all, prevent the pandemic happening.
But this is the biggest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We've just passed the brand of 7 billion.
By the way, the best protection of the population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it'll move from two billion to five billion user users.
Three billion minds have never been <unk> that add to the global conversation.
What would these people?
What do you want? What about <unk>
And instead of economic collapse we will have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And health care thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy of Khan Academy and because of the design of 3D printing, and the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can you give us three billion more members of humanity, healthy and <unk>
How about the voices never before we <unk>
What if we give them <unk> wherever they are, a voice to be heard, and we could act for the first time?
What would these three billion?
And if they are the contributions we can't <unk>
One thing I learned with the X Prize, is that a little guided equipment by their passion with a clear goal of course, they can do things <unk> things that before they could only do the big corporations and the governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you heard of.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
The folds determine the structure and these.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with these university professors, between others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people went on and started <unk>
And it has shown that today the machinery of recognition of human patterns is better folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, which gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take out the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that are <unk> to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have for a few decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
You might believe that they were <unk> but it wasn't like this.
It actually <unk> fish.
And he described to one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He was caught by the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red <unk> <unk>
But we've heard this story many times about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about it.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The <unk> still say they're still <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept of the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a pond, in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun, and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The <unk> was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from a few mangroves.
I had <unk> about 20 feet, the black <unk>
And the fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so he was earning more than the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the number of fish had dropped down in half.
<unk> at the age of <unk>
They had a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of fishing <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970 -- I first started in <unk> Europe made a lot of development projects.
<unk> development was supposed to impose to the countries that had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this kind of pretty cool boat, called <unk> four.
I went out to fish in him, and we did studies in the southern Sea Sea <unk> and, above all, in the <unk> Sea.
What we capture was something <unk>
<unk> now yes, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture was <unk> other animals that are in the bottom.
And most of the fish are <unk> tiny about <unk> remains that are <unk> fish.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then the commercial <unk>
The bottom goes from being a soft coral background, in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
I didn't hear them. The <unk> because they were dead.
Once we capture a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what they collect fishermen every time they go to an area where they never have fish.
But there's no <unk>
We <unk> the world but we don't remember it.
They <unk> the starting point to the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, number of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use <unk> images at the beginning of their conscious life as normal and then extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive the loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the <unk> of changes.
And in the end, you keep some <unk> <unk>
And that, in a big extent, is we want to do now.
We want to keep things that are no longer -- or not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies are killing animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very plentiful, before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose a little bit of animals.
Even if this doesn't perceive as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a <unk> sea of large fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
With the time there are few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know that it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they will do it because evidence introduced in a way before they would expect the evidence to have the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> like captain just like captain just and looked at a lot of fish in this area cannot be used, or generally don't use the scientists of the fishery, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
From there the huge role that can turn a protected marine area.
Because with the marine marine areas, we actually <unk> the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive of because the starting point has run and it's very low.
That's for the people who can see an marine marine area and they can benefit from the vision that they <unk> which allows them to erase their point of <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the people in the Midwest, for example?
I think that the arts and cinema may perhaps fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay <unk>
A long time ago, there were gray whales in <unk> Bay.
And you might notice that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were moved with the movie <unk> talking about the story of <unk> why do you <unk> with the <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give, is to <unk> <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> trends <unk> and I look at YouTube videos in a professional.
It's true.
So today we're going to see why the videos are <unk> and how important it has to do that.
We all want to be <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed very, very difficult.
But today the web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper in a part of our world culture.
Anybody can be famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They climb over 48 hours of video to YouTube for a minute.
And of those, just a small percentage of the <unk> gets a myriad of <unk> and makes cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, and a surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
KT: Oh, my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this filmed outside of his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the views on the popularity of last summer.
<unk> I don't want to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had been published many videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
He was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> I did this tweet that he <unk> the video to the <unk>
<unk> as Jimmy <unk> present things and interesting things and <unk> them to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, Friday. You have to start on the Friday.   You all want to get on the end of a week, the weekend.   <unk> <unk> <unk> on Friday.  KA: You don't think we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have come from nowhere.
So what happened this day?
Well, it's Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they're also Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular <unk>
Well, it took <unk> and a lot of blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people to make a joke on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of trends will take a point of view and they share with a broad audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who share this big internal joke then starts to talk about that and to do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment of the 20th century, this community engagement is our way to be part of the phenomenon -- or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a corresponding animation with a <unk> music.
That's it. That's it.
This year you saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that is rare, you know that there's a <unk> version of three hours of time.
Even cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats to see the video.
But what's important here is creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Someone did an old version of it.
And then it became international it.
Suddenly, I came up with a whole community of <unk> that made this to be a silly joke to something that we all can form there.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca Black or <unk> <unk>
What script might have been written that <unk> this situation?"
In a world where you go up two days of video -- just a minute that really unexpected and unexpected can be <unk> so these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a kind of protest that <unk> <unk> in New York, to admit that I didn't really have interested in me.
Casey <unk> I am <unk> by not circular for <unk> but often there are obstacles that can keep you circular with <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise to surprise and his humor, Casey <unk> made five million you saw and understand her idea.
So this approach is worth for all the new things that we make in creative ways.
And all of this leads us to a big question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> with creative communities, of participation, the completely unexpected, are features of a new kind of media -- of a new culture, which we all have access and is the audience that defines the <unk>
As I said before, one of the leading celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
Don't borrow permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little <unk> of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media, are just the current media characteristics, but we <unk> the future of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a lifetime.
It's a poet, a man whose entire life had been supported in the unique hopes of unity and freedom of his country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that his life had been totally <unk>
So the words, for so long -- my friends, now <unk>
It was <unk> in silence.
He died broken by history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that to be in <unk> and my lesson was learning that the story tried to <unk> but it was <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> <unk> into the sea.
My mother, <unk> had just 18 years old when her father died, and a <unk> marriage and two little girls died.
For her, life was meant to a <unk> task -- the escape of her family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> <unk> that the fiction, a boat would be slid into the sea <unk> <unk>
Every adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear was <unk> and rape and death.
Like most of the adults, my mother had a <unk> with poison.
If we were <unk> we would first take it from my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rhythm of the motor, the <unk> diving into each <unk> and the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember the pirates who came several times, but they were <unk> with the bravery of men on our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to tear for six hours.
But I do remember the lights of the oil platform on the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, to finish the journey was too much for it; and the first apple I tried, given by the <unk> men.
No apple had after the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations, shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> whose population is comprised of immigrants from <unk>
Unlike the middle of the middle class in the middle of the middle class -- the existence I <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the <unk> fragments of English <unk> among people who had one thing in common: They were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a car assembly line, working six days, double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a <unk> <unk> title of <unk>
We were poor.
And all the dollars were <unk> and established an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, it wouldn't mind what it was supposed to be <unk> which was usually <unk>
Two pairs in school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to <unk> because I had to last six years old.
And there were <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> back home.
And at home, where is at home, where do I die.
Something in me <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we would tell us about our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother had <unk> all of the ship.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares started to be <unk>
She opened a computer store, then studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And women were coming with their stories about men who couldn't make a <unk> angry and <unk> and <unk> <unk> trapped between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In fact, it was the classic classical student with what I <unk> of myself.
In the other, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically <unk> by violence, drug abuse and <unk>
But many of them had help over the years.
And for that work, when I was a senior in my last year of a lawyer and the young Australian young one.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges of not <unk>
So <unk> <unk> <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and social activist and invited to speak on sites that I had never heard of, <unk> and houses whose existence she would have ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat to the <unk> and the comfort of life in a suburb <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters end the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when we put up the ship.
The "no" had never been an option.
<unk> said to me, "What don't you <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> and <unk>
And the more I talked about, the more it was <unk> to talk about it.
I met people from all the roads in life, many of them doing what they were going to live on the border of the possible.
And although I finished my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk>
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time it's well to be a stranger, a <unk> new <unk> in the scene -- and not just that it's fine, but it's something that being grateful, maybe a ship.
Because being inside can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world gets <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was a energy there, a <unk> optimism -- a rare mixture of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
They went to a small group of people who the motto cannot <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I did a giant <unk> pot that everybody <unk>
<unk> until the night <unk>
Most of our ideas were <unk> but some brilliant ideas and we opened up.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
After a single journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later I had <unk> and <unk> adventure.
Before I finish, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who mattered to.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother raised alone.
By 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support of her husband, caused an <unk> to <unk> and lead the cause, she and so much more <unk> caused when I won.
It can't prove to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the room of a hotel in Sydney when she was killed, 1,000 miles in <unk>
I looked at the <unk> of the shower and I saw it stop on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell him stories and make sure that we were still with it.
At the night a monk came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> her hand.
I asked her to <unk> "Why your hand is hot, and the rest of the body is so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"Not <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Because of us who were and how life <unk> we can now see that the men who have come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat was very easily.
Now I want to have my own children, and I wonder about the ship.
Who might wish that for you?
But I fear the privilege of the easy law of the right.
I can give you a <unk> in your life, <unk> brave in every <unk> the <unk> pace of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee anything?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and see them safe, it would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is here today in the fourth or fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the singer <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the time of the ancient Indian <unk> called <unk>
In those days when we Indians we wanted to travel <unk> to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time when I was born, the great prince warrior Indian warrior -- I was <unk> taking a bow and a <unk> to the floor, he got water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion we took was that the machinery was replaced with magic.
And that was very <unk>
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I gave myself this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't help my friends.
I felt like technology had to allow magic, not <unk>
As a child, my grandfather gave me his pocket.
And this piece of <unk> that was for my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world filled with images of <unk> and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile phone, the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent them to <unk>
We <unk> our inspiration.
So I was <unk> I came up to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, rather than <unk>
I took books from 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a storytelling device able to connect the readers of the whole world.
You can know how to take the book out.
Where we are.
The text with the image, animation and sound and touch.
<unk> becomes increasingly <unk>
But what do you do for that?
I'm about to launch an interactive app for the iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so ...  He says, "This box called <unk> I write my name.
And so I become a character in the book.
In several times, I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live thanks to GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner girl gets excited.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but to that <unk> <unk> to those ideas that I <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always turned out <unk>
So over here, we have to shift the iPad to release fireflies.
And really, they light your way into the rest of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a girl was that a whole <unk> galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I <unk> into this magic device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In every fantasy book, there has always been maps but just been static maps.
This is a map that goes up, <unk> and guide you during the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to come in.
Another hugely important aspect for me is to create Indian content and to the contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of the <unk> and the <unk> but how many people outside of India know their counterparts in the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the chambers of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a personal <unk> history.
In a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> not the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to leave the outside, take the camera or iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For some reason children don't do it.
So to regain this childhood ritual you have to go out and in a chapter of <unk> a picture of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex, and then <unk>
So you create a digital collection of pictures that then you can put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a <unk> and says, "Oh, today I saw a <unk>
A boy from India says, "We saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Within the variants of the connection between magic, Earth and technology are many possibilities.
In the next book we have an interaction where you get out with the iPad and the video on, and using <unk> you see a <unk> <unk> group that appear on the inside of the house.
At a moment, the screen is full of leaves leaves ...
And you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> so you can read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature are <unk> with technology and magic and technology come to each other.
<unk> the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and love love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, the most important thing about that is we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> a director of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or he and I asked patients, family and <unk> What <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think -- that this is one of the biggest problems for all of us, or maybe not all of them, but most of the <unk> projects they fail as we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi <unk> It's something very simple.
It has a <unk> <unk>
Every morning I was <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put the challenge to 95 percent <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I <unk> sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is not at the same time when he needs <unk> <unk> or an urgency that style -- but it was going to see it backwards.
But there's something else.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi <unk> and before I go up to my car, people start <unk> <unk> today I think you need <unk>
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure from the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for the patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together to develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
So from next week to be available now.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people <unk> from their houses, they take their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, return back to control and to be captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us care about health care because of the challenges that we face, as the shot of the cost of <unk> attention and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did would like to share with you with you with a video.
We all have navigation navigation in the <unk>
Maybe we even have our cell phones.
We know perfectly where <unk> <unk> are <unk>
So where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find food chains.
But where is the nearest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked, but nobody <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please say, <unk> where, and when it's open, because sometimes they open up in the office <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we did an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you are in the city of <unk> and somebody <unk> can use their iPhone, and the next weeks to use your cell phone cell to find the nearest <unk> what can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this -- not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we would mean globally.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, at other universities, so that we will help us find and work like a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you get on vacation and somebody <unk> can be a relative or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
I also would like to invite companies around the world that could help us <unk> these <unk>
They could be <unk> or <unk> people for example, to see if the <unk> which is shown is still in their place.
Please <unk> in this and not just improve the health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share a picture of <unk>
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that can't take on your cameras.
My interest in photography was aroused with my first digital camera at 15 years.
It mixed with my earlier passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because using the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera -- the process ends up when the <unk>
For me photography I had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start from the press <unk>
<unk> like this: a construction on a very <unk> <unk>
But it has an unexpected turn.
And yet, in spite of it, it holds a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful pictures of it, but with the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say <unk> I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something I can <unk> but I always want it to seem like it would be captured in a way as photography.
<unk> where you will have to think of a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capture an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them seem real.
It's the details or the <unk>
Are you holding light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But in the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle puzzle where we actually take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three things that are perfectly <unk> something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But they combined in some way you can create something that still looks like <unk> as if we existed.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's go into the brain, because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't really make any sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It really consists of combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture seem realistic I think they're those ones that don't even <unk> the things around us in our everyday lives.
But by combining photographs, it's very important to <unk> because otherwise something will look wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the pictures combine must have the same kind of light.
And these two images have come along with these <unk> they were taken to the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think this is the image of a landscape and the lower part is <unk>
But this picture is completely composed of the photographs of different places.
<unk> I think it's easier to create a place that is finding it because you don't need to put in danger the ideas that you have in your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The shores of a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a <unk>
And yes, I even made the house on the top of the island to be more <unk>
So to make a realistic outcome I think you need to have a lack of planning.
You can always start with a sketch, an idea.
And then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful, and in the very realistic time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
Let me start showing you a slide of technology, very boring.
Please please, if you can <unk>
It's a diagram anybody I took from a mine.
I'm not interested in showing you the details but the general aspect of it.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of microprocessors and <unk> versus the power of local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as a lot of other that we tend to see, is a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves is something new.
Here's something strange.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please light the lights.
<unk> more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do you <unk> technological curves at <unk>
The answer is that if you draw them into a normal curve that you say, these are the years, or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I want to look at the diagram would look something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you will, for example, some other technology, like transport, on a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, you'd see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of <unk> transport technology is as fast as <unk> last morning we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go into that rhythm to that time.
There is no <unk> in the history of tech development that every few years forward orders of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- look at these <unk> curves we see they don't still exist.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
We get one of two things.
Or it's going to become a typical curve, I know like this until it comes to something completely different, or maybe do something like that.
That's all it can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what it used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask myself, is, what is that new way <unk>
What new state is going.
The transition seems very, very confused if we're engaged in it.
I remember the future happening in 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, across my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is going on.
That happens a transformation. Can you feel it.
And we know that it doesn't make a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because it all will be so different that extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have much to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at things in the long term.
The time scale that I'd like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at each billion years.
So you go back about half a billion years ago when the Earth was a big rock with a lot of chemicals that were <unk> around them.
If we look at the way those chemicals started, we give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there's theories to start to understand the origin of RNA. And I'm going to tell you a simple version of this -- and that is that, at that time, there were a little bit of oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those oil droplets held a particular combination of chemicals that made them to incorporate materials out of the outside and so drops grew up growing up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the <unk> cell forms, those oil <unk>
But those droplets were not alive, in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random prescription of chemicals.
And every time you <unk> <unk> a <unk> distribution of chemical <unk>
So every drop was a little different.
In fact, the droplets that somehow <unk> being better at the time to incorporate the chemical chemists to grow more, they grow more chemicals and more <unk>
They were usually more <unk> they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, very simple, very simple chemistry, but things get interesting when these drops learned the <unk> trick.
In some ways we don't understand very well these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to keep information, which was the recipe for the cell to a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this particular evolution -- a writing system that allowed them to record what they were in order to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved 2.5 billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
I have a hundred <unk> of white dust that I try to hide to airport security.
But <unk> Tom this <unk> code has the common letters that we usually use in this -- and I wrote my personal data into this piece of DNA and <unk> 10 to the 22 times.
So if somebody wants 100 million copies of my personal card, I have a lot of all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and is here.
If he was a <unk> I would have put it on a virus and would have been <unk> it over the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing of DNA was an interesting step.
So this made these cells were happy about another billion years.
But then it happened another big step in which things became very different, and it was that these cells began to exchange and communicate information to form that cell own communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, for example, they evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way they avoid penicillin and <unk> them to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are many resistant to penicillin, because bacteria communicate.
This communication led to place that they would get communities that in a way, were together on it, and a <unk>
From that <unk> or <unk> together, or whatever if a community was very successful all the individuals in that community became more and <unk> by evolution.
And the tipping point happened when these communities got so close to that, in fact, they came together and they decided to write the entire recipe in the community together in a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years to life.
And at that stage, we have communities, <unk> communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't work alone.
The skin cell is not true without the heart, or the <unk> or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and became more interesting levels that cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that were not doing more than process information in community.
They're the neural structures.
The neurons are the appliances that process the information that those cell bodies <unk>
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of <unk> understanding and transmit information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that time as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the period of evolutionary time.
So one organism could, for example, learn not to eat <unk> because he knew bad and got sick the last time she ate it.
That could happen during a life of a organism given that before they had built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit <unk>
So the fact that the nervous system built up these <unk> information structures enormously the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now occur to an individual.
It could happen in the time you need to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals found the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version that we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea, an idea of <unk> in the head.
I'm sitting here emitting some <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in your heads that keeps some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated that we turned it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started doing <unk>
We now go through periods similar to the <unk> organisms, our <unk> methods -- information processing and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a small step in that direction.
The <unk> computer tape <unk> <unk> and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now built to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and capable of evolved more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in <unk>
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced certain evolution with the <unk> program before our eyes.
And now we have accelerated time scales again.
The first stages of history that they told you was led to a billion years each.
The next few stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years old.
The <unk> the language, they took less than a million years.
And again, like the electronics, seems to take a few decades.
The process <unk> I suppose we <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make a living.
But now design such complexity that would be impossible for me to describe it in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor in that brain machine.
There are billions.
Instead, with <unk> designers -- we think about a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine and the machine that does something that I did before, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes it's used methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
We put in the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the <unk>
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer -- you can run a hundred million <unk> instructions to chance?
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, running all those programs, and to take those that more <unk> what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we find the programs that are closer to <unk>
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences.
But once he was able to put two numbers on the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that best did the <unk>
We <unk> those and <unk> the rest.
And now we <unk> the best ordered the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of <unk> analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that we <unk> children, that <unk> <unk> and the kids will reduce the properties of both programs.
So we managed to get a new generation of programs of programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
<unk> again.
So let's take some mutations here.
And it tries to new and <unk> with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in complicated, complicated, within hours.
In the end, we end up with programs that would have absolutely perfect numbers in this absolutely perfect way.
In fact, they're programs much more efficient than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to analyze them to see how they work.
They're dark <unk>
But do the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the safety of the target because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that they did as well.
In fact, their lives are dependent on this.
Once I was on a 747 in a 747 with <unk> <unk> and you get a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> working together to offer a <unk> flight, doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they're <unk>
So we started to depend on computers to make a very different design.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand the whole choices there is.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use these programs to make computers much faster and so they can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, they <unk>
The thing goes faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we're at a moment analogous to the <unk> organisms, when they became <unk>
We are <unk> and we can't understand what the hell are we creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to think that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think we all are part of the creation of whatever it is to come.
But now comes lunch and I think stop here before I was <unk>
I think we need to do something with a part of the medical culture that needs to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that is me.
And I've spent time enough to let me give you part of my fake <unk> in that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit of baseball.
Why not?
We are close to the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of the <unk> the <unk> talks about statistics and use to form a large baseball set.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you heard of.
It's called average <unk>
And we talk about 300, a <unk> that <unk> 300.
That means that the bat <unk> <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to launch the ball to the game field without being <unk> and anyone who tries to throw it back to the first base of it, not get to time, and the second base will be <unk>
<unk>
You know how to call a <unk> <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of the stars.
You know how to call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's somebody 10 <unk> <unk> four.
<unk> as the legendary Ted Williams, the last player in the League favor of <unk> in doing more 400 <unk> <unk>
Now I <unk> this to my medicine of medicine where I feel so much more comfortable or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and you go to a surgeon who has also a record record for 400 to <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a place, and a dear to have two arteries <unk> <unk> and your family doctor will come to a cardiologist whose record is <unk>
But you know what?
She's a lot of <unk>
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask you.
What do you think must be the average of hits for a heart surgeon or a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, very well.
And the truth is that nobody in the whole medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is sending them to the world, and I would be included included with the <unk>
We never, ever make a mistake and try and figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that I <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> student <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman <unk> to a blood test.
<unk>
<unk> in my little <unk> in the <unk> residence of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my kind of <unk> <unk> the origin and the <unk> of every artery of every artery that comes out of <unk> the diagnosis of differential and <unk>
And I even knew the <unk> <unk> of how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very right; I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> of the school of medicine with the impression that if you <unk> everything, then you would know everything, or the possible thing to the everything, because I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto when they brought the lady back to the emergency service where I was working.
At the time I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when the emergency room requested a cardiologist I was going to go to that patient.
and reporting to the <unk>
When I saw Mrs. <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when <unk> I heard a <unk> sound in both sides, which gave me a heart failure.
In these conditions the heart stops working and instead of <unk> the blood forward, the blood goes to our lungs, these are <unk> and that's why there's a hard to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I went to work on the treatment that I <unk>
He gave aspirin and medication to alleviate the pressure on his heart.
I gave him water <unk> so that it could get rid of liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt pretty good.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two mistakes more.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of <unk>
I didn't get up the phone and I did what I should have done, that I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen, it would have been able to add <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to pay attention to.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and capable of taking <unk> I could take care of my patients without even contact with my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I send it home, I didn't know a little attention to a voice in my interior who said, <unk> is not a good idea. Don't <unk>
In fact, I was so insecure that I had asked the nurse that he <unk> the Mrs. <unk> "Do you think he's okay with her <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said, "Yes, I think I'm right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed the high and the ambulance on the <unk> and they took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach.
But I kept following my job.
At the end of the day, I <unk> to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was in order to go home. At that time I did something I don't do normally,
I went through the emergency service service home.
And there is another nurse, not the <unk> of Mrs. <unk> before, but another one. He told me three words -- those three words that most of the emergency medical doctors.
Other people are afraid of it, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and we see the patients <unk>
The three words are <unk>
"It remembers the patient that sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
And she was okay.
But I went back and on the brink of death.
At the time of an hour he came to his house, after I gave her high and suffered a collapse and her family called the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> with a <unk> blood pressure of <unk> <unk> which means a shock of severe disease.
I was just breathing and it was blue.
<unk> personnel <unk> all of its resources.
They gave him medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mix of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive therapy and waiting for all the hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days it was obvious that I never <unk>
It had a permanent damage.
The family came to me.
And in eight or nine days, they went to what was going on.
And in ninth day, they let her go. Mrs. wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
So the weeks I'd like that, I was fascinated by that, and I experienced the <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt it alone, <unk> without feeling that shame she's healthy because you can't do it with your colleagues.
You make your peace and never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame that I talk about is the one that makes us very bad inside.
It tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we are bad.
And that felt.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was <unk>
I talked to the family, and I'm sure I <unk> the things and made sure that I don't care about.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he send her home?
And in my worst <unk> Why did I make a mistake that <unk>
Why did I chose medicine?
Little to that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And on one day, he opened the sky and finally came the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I did a deal with myself where if we were going to do the efforts to be perfect for not to make more mistakes, I would make those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it went back to happen.
Two years later, I was blown away in the emergency room in a community hospital in Northern Toronto, and I got a man of 25 years with a pain in her throat.
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I watched her throat, I was a little <unk>
They were <unk> penicillin and sent him home.
But as he ran to the door and still pointing his throat.
Two days later, when I came to make my guard, my chief asked me to talk to me in his office.
And he did the three words, he remembers you?
Remember the patient who saw a pain in <unk>
He came back and I didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but from the top, and that can cause the close of those tracks.
He said, fortunately, not <unk>
<unk> <unk> antibiotics for <unk> and <unk>
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then <unk> and went back to work, until it went over and over again and over again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> <unk> not <unk>
And this is a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because he would have 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> <unk>
They took an X-ray X-ray but it turned off. A colleague that was checking the patient from a certain sensitivity in the lower right quadrant, and called the surgeon a surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to <unk>
I checked it, and when you see some sensitivity in the lower right quadrant, called the surgeon a surgeon.
Both were operated and they recovered well.
But every single case I am <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as a lot of colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful have been over the last five years.
They are embarrassed and without support.
And here's the problem: If I can't go and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this so that they don't make the same <unk>
If I would walk into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think of me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- believe it would have a hard time to look at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total of the total of the mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> the ones that make mistakes and the ones that don't sleep and the ones who can't sleep, and the ones that I know; they have <unk> outcomes and the ones that have great results.
And it's almost like an <unk> reaction as antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if we go from medicine to people who make mistakes, we will get a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and journalism, I've made a personal study of bad medical <unk> and medical errors to learn as possible, from the first article I wrote to the Toronto "Star <unk> <unk> Black <unk> white, white, <unk> art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where the mistakes are happening every day, where one in 10 drugs are <unk> in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where <unk> infections are increasingly more and more <unk> by chaos and death.
In this country, there are 24,000 <unk> by errors in medical <unk>
The U.S. Medical Institute set out 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so they are things.
A <unk> system where knowledge is going off every two or three years, and we don't care about us.
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow to make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with pain in the chest, and it comes with <unk> eyes, and with breath to alcohol and all of a sudden, my story <unk> from contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't get their symptoms always in the same way.
For all of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like us, and we eliminate all the professional professionals to error, well, you won't get anybody.
And with regard to people who don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> white art, white art is already a custom to say, "This is my worst <unk> I would tell you all of the <unk> to the head of <unk> surgery -- "This is my worst <unk> blah blah blah -- "What is your <unk> and <unk> the microphone towards them.
And his students <unk> <unk> <unk> the head and <unk> saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a medical <unk> culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> <unk> is human, you know a human, you accept it, and it's not proud of your errors, but it tries to learn from what's happened to teach others.
They <unk> their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
We promise the mistakes of other people not with intention of <unk> but in a loving way and they support for everybody to <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in a time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk>
I am human.
And I feel so much but I get to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words <unk> I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day.
Do you know how much we choose a week?
Recently, I did a survey for more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choice that he says to pick up an average American, it's about 70 a day.
Not a long ago, in a research on a week to a group of presidents of companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks of these executives and the time that we were trying to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> a week.
Naturally, every job involved many <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of your time.
Now think about your choices.
Do you know how many of you belong to the <unk> <unk> and how many of the <unk>
How does the way the way they manage those <unk>
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choice for the <unk> of choices.
I want to talk about the problem and about possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, your hand just if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question: Are you ready to hear the problem of the <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> this very, very <unk> supermarket, at least in that time was very sophisticated.
His name was <unk>
It was almost like going to an amusement park.
It was like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruit and vegetables and about 25 <unk> water. And this was when you take water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but one occasion, why never buy nothing?
This is a shelf of the oil <unk>
They had over 75 different classes, including those who were in <unk> box that came from trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and I asked him, <unk> this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed to me full buses that came up every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
<unk>
They had <unk> different classes.
You put a <unk> on the entrance to the shop.
We put it up there, six <unk> or 24 flavors and we see two things: First of all, where people were willing to stop testing the <unk>
More people stopped at the time when I had <unk> 60 percent that when there were only six, 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a <unk> <unk>
This is the opposite effect.
Where they stopped when there was 24, only three percent came to buy <unk>
So when there were six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six, that if they were 24.
Well, decide that we don't buy <unk> -- probably <unk> -- less is good for conserving <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the <unk> of choices affects us in good decisions.
We decided not to decide, even though this doesn't be <unk>
Now the issue of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see the decisions about savings for the retirement of a million Americans, from about 650 plans in the country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of food funds available in savings plans for retirement, program <unk> to people save for the future.
And we found that really there was a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, to 59 options.
We found that the bigger the number of funding was <unk> there were less participation.
So if you look at the extremes, we see that in the plans that you offer two funds, the rate of participation was 70 percent or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans to give about 60 to the rate of participation.
It turns out even if you decide to participate, when there are more choices, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for the ones that they decided to participate, the bigger the number of options, more people will be prevented by avoiding the actions or hedge funds.
As much more options, they were more willing to invest in financial accounts for market.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we <unk> to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three negative negative consequences to offer more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that we will make the decision -- even when it goes against their own self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst <unk> in finance and health.
They're more likely to pick things less <unk> even though objectively going better.
The main reason is that we <unk> with looking at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for <unk> to contrast and choose that awesome <unk>
Today I want to share with you with four simple techniques that we've <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so you can test it in your business.
The first one is <unk>
You've heard before, but it's never been more true than today, than less is more.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're looking at more and more is that if you choose to cut, you get rid of odd options, there will be a increase on sales, <unk> the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, you saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the corporation <unk> <unk> eliminated the products for <unk> that less <unk> increased <unk> in <unk> by two <unk> more sales and smaller costs.
You know the retail supermarkets, on average, offer 45,000 products.
In a Walmart store, you have about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the world today is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a tomato tomato sauce <unk>
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to manage the choices is David <unk> the <unk> program.
All of the <unk> employees are <unk> automatically at a safe supply of life.
The people who really want to choose, they give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know that often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
They're all options <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that are among those choices.
And if your employees can't <unk> you can't do their <unk>
This evening, before I started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that I would be willing to offer people to the people of this audience on a holiday to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want the <unk>
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give a applause if you're ready to take the offer of <unk>
<unk> <unk> Okay. Anyone who's ready to accept the supply.
Are you not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who's ready for that journey?
I think I really got to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information at the first trial, than in the second trial, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of choice <unk> which is <unk>
For people to understand differences between the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must feel very <unk> very unusual.
Why are people spending 15 percent more on average when you use credit cards or credit cards that when it uses <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to save more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And that meeting is that we <unk> exactly how we did a little <unk>
What we added was we requested the staff who would think of the positive things that would be <unk> in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was a increase in the <unk> of the 20 percent and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or whatever they wanted to put on their <unk> accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than choices.
For example, this is a study we did in a field of magazines.
We saw that in <unk> supermarkets throughout the corridor of the <unk> the journal exhibit can contain from <unk> different kinds of <unk>
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk> <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
<unk> Well, there's some of them.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
Turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know what?
This <unk> scheme is totally useless.
<unk> must indicate something to anyone who <unk> not when they <unk>
And you often see this problem with these huge lists of funding.
I am supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can manage a lot more information than we think about if we just <unk> it a little bit.
We need to increase the complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a good decision -- you buy a car.
This is a German car manufacturer that lets it completely <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions to build the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that each one offers each other.
<unk> the outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box box <unk> <unk>
What I'm going to do is change the order where the decisions.
So half of the clients are going to go in many choices, 56 colors, a few <unk> four boxes.
The other half of the clients are going to be a few options, four <unk> to 56 colors, a lot of choices.
And what about <unk>
How involved you are.
If you <unk> the default button on every decision, this indicates that you're <unk> or <unk> we're being lost.
We found that the ones that go from many choices for a few choices -- <unk> the default button over and over and over again.
<unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, they go there.
The same information, the same number of choices.
The only thing that I did was disrupt the order for the order to present information.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Even though the box of change doesn't say anything about the preferences of inner <unk> in all ways we would be happy to choose.
We're excited about a product that we're building now has more engaged in the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All these techniques that I've been presented with were designed to help manage <unk> or better for you, to use them in their own business, or for people who do work.
I think the key to get the best of a choice is being careful about <unk>
And the more careful we're going to be in our best choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the years <unk> in Eastern Germany, if you had a typewriter of writing should be <unk> in the government.
I had to register a piece of text of example written with the machine.
And this is why the government could track the origin of the <unk>
If they found a script with the wrong message you could track the footprint up to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't conceive of that someone could do this, how much that was going to make freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color printer from any big manufacturer and prints a page, that page will end up having a few yellow dots printed on every page that makes you a pattern that makes you and your printer.
That's happening today.
And no one seems <unk> a lot about this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If we see what happens in the online world we can put together the attacks on its <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the cyberattacks to win a lot of money, huge amounts of money.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys are doing their online <unk> but they do it by illegal media through <unk> <unk> to steal money from our bills when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy a computer <unk>
The secret service of America, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this counts had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> don't know her <unk>
And I say that today is more likely than any of us is a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going wrong in worse.
In the future, most of the <unk> <unk> online.
The second group of <unk> in importance that we see today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves, ask the protests, the protests, the protests, the <unk> motivate them laughter.
<unk> as Anonymous have <unk> over the last 12 months occupying a major role in online attacks.
Those are the three <unk> <unk> criminals who make it for money, <unk> them as Anonymous that they do to protest and the last group are the national states that <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is an <unk> authority authority in the Netherlands or actually it was.
It would be <unk> last fall because of a <unk>
You can get the safety of the site and took a <unk>
Last week I asked, at a meeting with the Dutch government, asking one of the leaders if they were <unk> <unk> death of people because of the attack to <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die of an attack of these?
<unk> is an <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
So what do you do?
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services -- <unk> services like <unk>
Except that <unk> a foreign <unk> authority.
And they will also <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the protesters protesters were based on the Israeli Egyptian police, in April 2011 and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
In those papers I was this folder called <unk>
And within that manila folder, there were a company based on Germany based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government to intercept the communications of citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 40,000 euros to the <unk> government.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, the Western governments provide the tools to governments that provide them tools.
But Western governments also do this themselves.
For example, in Germany, a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government officials to research their own citizens.
If you are suspicious of a case in criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes beyond today.
The Internet connection.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all of communication, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think very closely in things like these the obvious answer should be good, it seems to be a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why do you <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's playing privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could rely on our governments today in 2011, whatever right you would have today will be forever.
Would you just blindly <unk> in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that must be worried about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the south of sub-Saharan Park.
These are the cows of my father, at the bottom, and behind the cows, the National Park of Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences in most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate freely outside the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed the night, and as soon as we wake up in the morning, and I found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came out of the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and so we value them.
So I grew up with a lot of the lions.
They were dying of them are warriors that protect our community and won, and they're also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think that's why there are so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A boy in my community, in six to nine years old, is responsible for the livestock of her father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to fix this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions would fear.
But I realized that this is not really <unk> because even she helped lions see the pen from far.
I don't know me <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
He was trying to <unk> lions so they believed that I was near the <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came the first day and saw the <unk> and they were gone, but the second day, they came back and said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So it was always here.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come from.
I found that male lions are afraid to the light that moves around.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch with the one to turn out the lights.
And this is a little <unk> <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity into the small box <unk> I call it a transformational.
And the box <unk> makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> get outside, because that's where the lions.
And this is how you see male lions when they come at night.
The lights are <unk> and <unk> lions so you think I'm walking through the <unk> but I am sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my home two years ago, and since then, we never had a problem with lions.
And the houses of the neighborhood you heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals that lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see the <unk> these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've been installed in seven houses in my community, and they're serving so much.
And my idea is also used by all of Kenya, to scare other predators like hyenas, <unk> and it's also using <unk> elephants from farms.
And thanks to this <unk> I was fortunate to get a scholarship to one of the best schools in Kenya, International International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise funds and <unk>
It even took my friends to my community, and we installed lights in the houses that don't have it, and show them how they <unk>
So a year ago, I was just a child in the <unk> of the <unk> the cows of my father, and I used to see airplanes and said to me that someday it would be within one.
And here I am.
I got an opportunity to come in an airplane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer of aviation and pilot when they <unk>
I used to hate the lions, but now like my invention is saving to the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to listen to a story like anything.
So you got a scholarship. Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: Are you working on other <unk>
What's the next one in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to make an electric <unk> CA: <unk> near <unk>
<unk> I know you already invented <unk> <unk> but I want to do my own.
CA: So I read it once, right, and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: <unk> <unk> Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We go to <unk> in every single step that you have a friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a small age, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "I <unk> nothing."
And I felt very proud.
In school, we spent all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot about the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
Even though I asked myself about the rest of the world, I thought I spent my entire life in North Korea, until everything changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public <unk>
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I had never gone hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my colleague of my sister.
He said, "When you <unk> this -- the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks of past.
We're <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, we're ready to die."
I was very <unk>
I was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
When I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't delete my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a little boy in her arms watching her face of her mother without being able to do anything.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
An enormous famine led to North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and tree trunk.
They also became more and more prevalent -- the <unk> of energy, all around me was completely dark at night except by the sea lights in China, just crossing the river from my home.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea in the night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> river which serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of North Korea, but I can only say that during the famine years I was sent to China to live with <unk> relatives <unk>
But I just thought that I would be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was difficult to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like refugee <unk>
But I soon learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but it's also dangerous, because the refugees North Koreans in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate back in North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare was made of reality, when I was arrested by the Chinese police and <unk> at the police station.
Someone had been accused of being <unk> then my skills in the Chinese language, and I got a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a officer said to another, "This was a fake <unk> She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking at <unk> <unk>
But many of you can be arrested by Chinese and <unk>
These women were so lucky.
Even though there were <unk> were eventually released after an international pressure.
These North Koreans were so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to leave, many other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragedy that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and find work, all of their world can <unk> in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to be able to hold South Korea going to South Korea.
And I started new life again.
He was in South Korea a much greater challenge than I had expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and south.
We're all <unk> but in the inside, we've come to be very different because <unk> <unk>
I even went through an identity.
I'm <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country that I could call my proud <unk>
Although I went to life in South Korea it wasn't easy, I made a plan. I started studying for the exam exam to college.
Just when I started <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authority was a little bit of money that sent my family to my family, and as you know, my family was going to be displaced to force to a location in the <unk>
They had to flee immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border of North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to <unk> it in some more than 3,000 miles through China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we almost went down several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and tackled by a Chinese police officer.
He asked me the identification of all and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be <unk>
When the Chinese official came up to my family, I stood up and I told him they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me, but fortunately I believed it.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and imprisoned for crossing the border of <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did all of her to release my family, and we were so close to it, but my family was <unk> in prison in the short distance of South Korea embassy <unk>
I was going to come between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man ask me, "What is the problem?"
I was so shocked that a stranger would mind asking to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Koreans and take them from prison.
I <unk> with all my heart, and I asked her, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> I told you.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind of <unk> <unk> a new hope for me and for the <unk> people when you get the <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the international community are really the rays of hope that the people <unk> needs.
Over the time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea, my family.
But they achieve their freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they <unk> a new country, they start with a little bit of money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practical language practices and more.
We can also act as a bridge between North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us keep in contact with family still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help <unk> an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans <unk> around the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Texas.
This is <unk> <unk> stores of <unk> fast food, <unk> terrain.
So the city planners came together, and they thought, we're going to change the South Center for it to represent something else, so they switched to Los Angeles as if this is <unk> what is actually wrong with the city.
This is the South L.A.  <unk> of <unk> fast food, <unk> terrain.
Just like <unk> million other Americans, live in a food desert, in Los Angeles South Africa, home from food places to take and eat in the car.
The funny thing is that the places of food to lead to kill more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in Los Angeles South America.
For instance, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times more than say, Beverly <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
I emphasize this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time they come out of home, you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in its <unk>
I see chairs from wheelchair and sold like cars <unk>
I see <unk> centers, <unk> <unk>
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and it's the solution.
And I got tired of driving about 45 minutes back and back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, it was plant a forest forest in front of my house.
In a <unk> of land that we call a <unk>
This is 45 by three feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it going.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes in wins, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided to keep it going.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we put us together and we started planting our food forest -- trees -- you know, the nine <unk> <unk>
What we do, we are a kind of paid group <unk> for gardeners of all the <unk> of all the city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, I was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
The city stood up on top and <unk> I was given a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> made a <unk>
And I said, "Come on on it?
A judicial order to plant food on a piece of land that no one was <unk>  So I was like, "Okay, <unk>
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had been written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the Green <unk> who put a petition to <unk> with 900 <unk> we were successful.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, why is it?
L.A. is the city of America with more <unk> <unk>
It has 68 miles of <unk> <unk>
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space to plant <unk> million <unk> plants.
Why on earth do you don't look like this?
<unk> a plant will give a thousand, 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars of a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, you cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South <unk>
I grew up there. <unk> my kids there.
I was telling myself to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to get my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I'm growing my art.
Like an artist of <unk> that <unk> walls -- I <unk> floors, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You can see what the Earth can do, if they let it be their canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm a witness of how my garden became a tool of education in the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of land.
We are the land.
You can see how it affects children.
<unk> is the most <unk> act that they can do, especially in a <unk>
In addition, they get <unk>
And I remember one occasion, who came a mother and daughter, who were like the <unk> at night and were in my garden, I went out and looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this way.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I saw people who were so close to me with hunger, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> don't temes people go to steal your <unk>
What I say, "Oh my God, I'm not afraid I'm going to go to <unk>
That's the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at your time, I want you to <unk> your <unk>
There was another occasion where I put a garden in a homeless shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, and he shared her stories about how this had been affected and how they used to plant them with her mom and her grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people who come, work and <unk> all in a volunteer.
If kids are growing <unk> kids will eat <unk>
If nothing else is going to eat <unk>  But if none of this will be <unk> if you don't teach them how food affects your mind and the body, they eat blind people to put them on front.
I see young people who want to work on, but they have this thing that they're stuck with, I see color kids who are on this path designed for them, that doesn't take them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these guys who get away from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of land, we never will.
Now this is one of my agenda, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take container and turn them into <unk> healthy.
I don't care.
I'm not talking about free, because the free free is not sustainable.
What's funny about sustainability, is that you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to put people out of the street to get the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, by opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everybody to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We have to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Do you take them out of your <unk> OK?
That is his weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to meet me, I won't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about <unk>
If you want to see me, you come into the garden with your <unk> so you can plant something.
<unk> Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me where this is a very <unk> road here.
It's made out of <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days as it rains very much.
You can have a lot of water on asphalt that you can imagine.
And especially if they are <unk> on your bicycle and these cars go down, it's not very nice.
In addition, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to the cities, we would want a quiet road in a <unk>
The solution for that is to make roads of asphalt <unk>
<unk> asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, and it has pores and water can go through it, so that all the rainwater flow on the sides and you will have a road for which it's easy to drive, and you don't get a road for which it is easy to drive, and not <unk> water, not more.
The noise will also disappear into these <unk>
Because it's very open, all the <unk> so it's a very quiet road here.
It also has some <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> See that on this road the rocks of the surface is <unk>
First one stone, then several more and more and more, and then then -- well, I'm not going to do that.  But you can damage your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create <unk>
<unk> He's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see how the damage appears in this material.
It's a asphalt asphalt as I said, so it only has a small amount of <unk> between <unk>
Because of <unk> to light <unk> this <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they are <unk> they will move away from the <unk>
So if you drive around the road, you will see the <unk> as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material happen, then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is to use wool wool from that to clean <unk> and we can cut the steel wool into very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little bits of steel wool in it.
Then you need a machine, like what you see here, that you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel is really good at that.
So what you have to do is to heat the steel, melt the <unk> flow from these <unk> and the stones will move back to the surface.
Today I used a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the big <unk> machine here to the stage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put this sample, I'm now going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried a lot of samples out there, and then the government, really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So we made a piece of road, 400 feet of the highway <unk> where we had to do a lane of trial to test this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were making the test on the road, and then of course, this road last several years without damage -- that's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road and we test them in the lab.
We made samples, we put a lot of burden on them, the <unk> then with our <unk> machine, and we cut them back into it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, in closing, I can tell you that we've made a material using <unk> fibers using these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, you can even double the life of the road, will actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they're curious about whether it also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
In fact, you have to cool it first before I can show you how the repair acts itself.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was hearing BBC in his little gray radius.
He had a great smile in her face that was unusual at those times, because the news is usually <unk>
The Taliban <unk> "My father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> <unk> he told me.
One morning I will never forget.
True school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban got rid of Afghanistan and made girls illegal that girls were to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister who could no longer be used outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way we could see it <unk>
Every day, we would take a different route so that no one could be suspicious of where you <unk>
We had to hide the books in market bags so we were shopping.
The school was in a house, over 100 of us <unk> in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
All of us knew that we were going to <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Every once in a week, the school suddenly got a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they did of us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to go.
We were <unk> but yet, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters were <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for her time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> where his daughter, my mother, was to school and why her father would get it.
But my educated mother got mastery.
This is it.
He went back two years ago, just to turn our home in school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that her children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk to not educate your children.
Over the years of <unk> I remember that there were moments where I was very frustrated for our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can let them leave your house during a war.
But there is one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will.
So you still want to <unk>
Today I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country which has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of my age have more than the <unk> and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
I find myself proud to graduate me in <unk> College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was <unk> from her home for the courage to educate her daughters, was one of the first in <unk>
He didn't just get away from my university title, but I was also the first woman, and I am the first woman, who took him driving over the streets in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I think a big dream -- but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global <unk> of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
That's why I cofounded the first and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like mine, <unk> for them, despite even in front of an opposition <unk>
As <unk> It's not his real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went on the way from <unk> to her village, and literally escaped to be killed by a pump on the road, for minutes.
And when you get to your house, they are the phone, a voice told her that if he kept sending her daughter to school, they would be going to try.
<unk> now, if <unk> said, "but it doesn't harm the future of my daughter for her old and <unk> <unk>
What I've been given from Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind the most of the people who <unk> there's a father who recognized the value of her daughter and he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean our mothers have not been key in our success.
In fact, they are often the first <unk> compelling future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school on <unk> remember, was illegal.
But today, more than three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the United States.
I find Americans see the fragility of changes.
It turns out that these changes would not last long after the <unk> of U.S. troops
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at students in my school and their parents that I <unk> for them, that <unk> I see a <unk> future and <unk> future.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for me, and every day, the girls of <unk> I <unk>
As I do, they dream big.
Thank you.
never, I've never forgotten my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never go back a revolutionary <unk> <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the broke revolution broke inspired by the <unk> of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution like <unk>
One forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside of the country to call one day of anger and starting a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And the <unk> was a big revolution.
Women and young men <unk> were in the middle, <unk> the fall of the regime, <unk> <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
You've shown you a copy of the face of the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the Middle East, all the way down to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and a loss of about 50,000 people -- we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy load, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> of the devastation and the challenges, I have dear, next to many other women, rebuild the civil society <unk> a transition and fair transition to democracy and <unk> national <unk>
There are about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> About 300 in <unk>
After a <unk> period of exile, I went back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm -- I started organizing workshops about the development of capacity, and leadership skills.
With an amazing group of women we founded the <unk> of Women who are <unk> by <unk> a movement of women, <unk> orientation was very <unk> to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of the woman and for our right of participation <unk> in building democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was increasingly <unk> which was <unk> from the <unk> policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was <unk>
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the early elections in 52 years.
However, a little bit, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of ancient mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day I was <unk> with the news of the murder of the American <unk> and the heart attack.
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder murder of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of <unk> and their infinite human rights violations.
Our society, made up by a <unk> mentality more and away from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, which we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> became the icon of the consequences of revolution.
I'm not here at all here at all to do with our story of the success of the <unk> <unk> and the election.
Rather, I'm here today to say, as a nation we chose bad, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because the choices didn't bring peace and stability and security to Libya.
The list of <unk> and the <unk> between candidates and candidate brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and <unk> as much by women?
Perhaps what they missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus over what the election needed to do -- that only <unk> polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the <unk> representation of the <unk> more than the <unk> performance and quantitative thing.
We need to stop acting as <unk> and call it a few days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female discourse that not only <unk> but also putting it in practice <unk> rather than <unk> collaboration rather than <unk> and <unk> rather than <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> by the war, desperately desperately with the end of the peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interconnection and the <unk> between female and male <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the <unk> traditions -- has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> that spans the whole humanity that men and women, than all tribes and all the people have <unk>
And so, like the uterus completely covers the <unk> that grows inside the divine matrix of compassion is <unk> all of existence.
So he says, "My <unk> <unk> all the things."
So he says, "My <unk> <unk> on my <unk>
They were all <unk> the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a <unk> question, which has an equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to think about is the one that everybody <unk> Why is she left?
Why was somebody going to stay with a man who <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, no social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
He was 22 years old. He had been <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York for my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American <unk> and he had a very big secret <unk>
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my alma mater, <unk> my head with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The man, when I loved anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> trap of love, where it's every year millions of women, and even some men.
Until it could be their story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for the <unk> list, <unk> between those Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I've been almost 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all the races, all of the religions, all the levels of income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse is only going on in <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> or, in the families, in the families, the last place where we want or expect to find <unk> reason why violence abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would be left with a man who <unk> and I was actually a very typical victim because of my age.
He was 22 years old, and in the United States women in between 16 and 24 years old have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than other ages, and over 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I also went a typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold and <unk>
I was sitting next to my side in my side in New York City and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just <unk> from a university of the <unk> <unk> and I worked on a very big bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and that looked like a guy in the field.
I had a few big <unk> like apples, and a hair <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that he did <unk> from the very beginning, was creating the illusion that I was the dominant component of <unk>
He did it on the beginning of <unk> in a <unk>
We started out and I loved everything from me -- that was ready -- that I'd gone a passion to help teenage girls and my job.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, like anyone had ever done it.
And it was why the arts in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any domestic violence relationship is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went out of New York and leaving the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I quit my work and <unk> and I went together from Manhattan.
I had no idea I was falling in a <unk> <unk> who was entering a head of physical and financial and psychological psychological <unk> <unk>
The next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce violence to see how it reacts it.
And this is where these weapons come in.
And as soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where you are supposed to be so safe had to be bought three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another one was stored under the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said she needed those guns to cause trauma that lived in a small basis.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and even though I had never lifted my hand, my life was already serious for me every minute every single day.
The first physical attack was five days before our wedding.
It was seven in the morning and still put the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my girlfriend suit of my mother and married him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that we were living happily forever, because I loved her and he wanted me so much.
And I was very, very <unk>
There was just very <unk> in the wedding and for the fact of being a family with me.
I had been a isolated accident, and I never would make it harm.
We spent two times more on our honey.
The first time I was driving into a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so hard at the head that we were <unk> various times against the car <unk>
And then a couple days later, we drove back to our <unk> of <unk> <unk> by traffic, and I threw a Big Mac <unk>
<unk> continued to <unk> one or twice a week for the next two and the half of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One in three American women is about domestic violence or <unk> at some point in their life, and the Centers for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had a very good company.
To go back to my question: Why do I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was <unk>
On the contrary, I was a strong woman in love in love with a profoundly <unk> man and was the only person in the world who could help <unk> her <unk>
The other question all the world does is: Why don't you just <unk>
Why not <unk> I could have been at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we all know the victims, we know something that you normally know -- it's incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the domestic violence pattern is <unk>
More than 70 percent of domestic violence in cases of domestic violence occur after the victim has finally put the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Some repercussions include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to <unk> <unk> of financial resources, and manipulation of the family family system to <unk> the victim and their children, who are usually forced by judges to spend the guy who <unk> their mother.
And we still follow asking why it's just not doing?
I was able to go, and I was able to go from one last <unk> beat my denial.
I realized that the man I loved so much, would have killed me if it was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told the whole world -- to the police, to my neighbors and friends and family and full strangers, and I'm here today because all of you helped me help me.
We have the tendency to <unk> victims such as <unk> women, <unk> goods.
The question, "Why do you <unk>
For some people a way to say <unk> it's by <unk> as if the victims of the <unk> <unk> <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I posted <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also claim that they learned a <unk> lesson of what happened to them and that they will make their lives <unk> and happy lives like <unk> wives and mothers, completely free of violence like mine.
Because it turns out that I am actually a victim and a survivor of domestic violence very typical
I got married with a cute little man, and we have those three kids.
I have that black <unk> I have that <unk>
What I'm not going to have is never more, you ever have a <unk> gun that comes to my head in somebody who tells me.
Right now, you are thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> what stupid <unk> but all this time I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you, there are a few people that are listening to me right now, that are being <unk> or that they were <unk> or they were <unk> themselves.
The <unk> might be affecting his daughter, to her sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love <unk> breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my final appeal to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> just in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence by simply shedding light on it.
The victims need all the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
It <unk> the <unk> of the light by talking about it with their children, their fellow jobs, their friends and family.
<unk> their view of survivors as fantastic people and <unk> that have a future <unk>
<unk> the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to stop their climb and show the victims a safe exit
And together we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the <unk> safe and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call myself Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this point, there's a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have been dressed like this.  Luckily, I brought up clothes to <unk>
This is the first change of clothing on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of luck in <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they were <unk> they don't have to be <unk> now, but they find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think of myself in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These <unk> are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is going through this sweater over the head, because it's when they go to laugh from me, so you don't do anything while I cover his head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I have completely changed what they thought of me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that he <unk> the back and that <unk> the kid.
Of course, except with surgery or a <unk> artificial <unk> like the one I did two days ago for work, there is very little that we can do to transform our appearance, which, although superficial and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I am a model.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my workforce, that's a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
I always say, <unk> <unk> but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic bone, and I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and you might be wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which are biologically hardwired to <unk> we also have associated with a high and <unk> shape and a white skin.
And that's my <unk> <unk> that I've been able to harness to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience that now shows <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> in the fashion that you <unk> Hold on. There are <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> for knowing as much as models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student from the University of New York told all and every one of the models in the <unk> and of the <unk> models, just <unk> is to say, less than four percent, they weren't white <unk>
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be a model when it is <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't take care of that.
But then, what I would really tell you to each of these girls is, why? You can be whatever you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a <unk> <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be <unk> because you were the first.
If you were after this spectacular list, I still <unk> No, no, <unk> I want to be model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the <unk> <unk> of American <unk> or the <unk> executive <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you want to be a model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're older.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to demonstrate all I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike the <unk> surgery can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Sadly, once you put your studies, and you have a test and a few jobs on your backs, no matter what you want, you know, if you <unk> you want to be president of the United States, but you have a <unk> <unk> of underwear for 10 years, people would look at you weird.
The next question that people always do is if all the photos are <unk>
And yes, virtually all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
So this was the first picture I was <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my <unk>
I know we're entering the personal field, but I was a little girl.
I was looking at my grandmother a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
I'm at a <unk> party a few days before the French <unk>
Here I am with my soccer team and in <unk> magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize that I'm not me in those pictures.
They're the <unk> of a group of professional professionals, <unk> photographers and <unk> and all of their <unk> and people from <unk> and <unk> and they can create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is: <unk> things for free?
I have too much about 20 inches and I never use, except the privilege I get, but the privilege I get in the real life, and that we don't like to talk.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a shop and forgot to take money, and they gave me the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> stepped up a red light and of course, <unk> and <unk> -- a little bit of sorry, agent so we can keep going.
<unk> of these privilege for me, and I don't know what I am. And there are people who pay for a price for the way no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, of the teenagers who stood up and 86 percent were black and Latino -- and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> black and Latino kids in New York, so for them, that's not a question of <unk>
I know how many times I <unk>
As I research for this talk, I found out that at 53 percent of the <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes up to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is: If you're a bit thinner and you have the most bright hair, you'll feel so happy and I say.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe you can do it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with creative people, ingenious and <unk>
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my mind every day.
And if you ever ask them, I had a little <unk> and the <unk> hair will be happier?
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most <unk> legs that are the brightest hair and the clothes more to the fashion but probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of racial and gender oppression when I'm one of the biggest <unk>
If there's something to retain this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable to recognize the power of the image in perception that we have from success and failure.
Thank you.
<unk> has been my passion since I was older enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 <unk> pictures -- and I didn't go to the <unk>
There were no <unk> and no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a safe minimum of lighting.
In fact, most of them were taken at random.
My story starts when, <unk> in New York to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on the day of her first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and five.
I thought we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I approached the third birthday of my daughter, my wife said to me, why don't you take you to join New York on a <unk> journey, and you carry the <unk>
So here is when we started to ask the tourists that were going to get us out of the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of giving the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has been denied and fortunately, no one has <unk> with the camera.
So we were not aware of how much we would change this journey.
It became sacred to us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day as a five year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time on a week of October and we think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, although we always took the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter has new <unk> and I can see life through your eyes and how you perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time in concrete that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion all the year.
So recently, on one of the trips -- we were walking, when they suddenly stopped in the dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the shoe store, which was a little bit of a little guy in the previous <unk>
And it described me what it was five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> who remembered their heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create is the memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively engaging in the creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I am always getting the picture.
Today, I want to encourage you all to appear in the picture, and I didn't want to go up with somebody and ask him, you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are found in the <unk> <unk> group.
First of all, why are they so bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney laughs as <unk> silly characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter and applause and <unk> these are the attributes that relate to Parliament as <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament are not keeping the environment.  They don't help prevent the spread of disease.
They are hardly <unk>   And they're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World who are mostly found in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of the World World, where we have 16 species of these 16, of these 16, the high risk of extinction.
So why are they? are important, first of all, provide vital ecological services.
It's our <unk> of natural <unk>
<unk> the cadavers to the bone.
They help kill all the bacteria. They help absorb anthrax that will not be <unk> and caused huge loss of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent surveys have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the cadavers take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of <unk>
<unk> also have huge important importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of <unk> and the maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the Alto and the unit Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, they are doing very important <unk> to open sky in places like <unk> no place to bury the dead and wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are on extreme <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the endangered <unk> <unk> which means that in less than 10 or 15 years, and the reason is because they fall prey from the <unk> consumption that has been treated with a <unk> drug.
This drug has been banned by using vet in India and have taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of dogs <unk> in <unk> <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge <unk> of time to <unk> The number of cases of anger has increased in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be above Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to the birds.
They're <unk>
In Africa, we have a horrible trade trade in Africa to serve <unk> and to the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel around different countries, so to focus on a problem locally is not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments at the regional level.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and services that are <unk>
How can you help? It can become active to make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you, we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you go out of this room, they will tell you about the <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed the opinion because he saw it <unk> without effort, no energy expenditure in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every single thing I do, and all I do <unk> my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young -- but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, <unk> of <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
And then I went to the 21, that the Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything you would have to do is <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from the <unk> was a project where we were a few Italians -- we decided to teach people about Zambia to grow food.
So we got out with <unk> <unk> to the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the <unk> River and we teach the local <unk> and Italians and <unk> and ...
Of course, people were not interested in doing that, so they were going to help them to come to work, and sometimes they were not <unk>  We were convinced that the local people, in the <unk> hadn't had agriculture.
However, instead of asking them how it was possible that we were not <unk> nothing, we simply said, "Thank God we're here."  <unk> time to save the people of Zambia from <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa is <unk> <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato would grow up to this size. In Zambia, to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to the <unk> look at how easy it is <unk>
When the tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you <unk> "You're never <unk>
I thought we only had the <unk> of mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, what the people were doing and what the writers were doing and then saw what the writers were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, you know, at least we feed the <unk>
Let's see the <unk>  <unk> see the waste that <unk> the <unk> people in Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> economist, <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, countries, Western donors have given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I don't tell you about damage that that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> from an African woman, the harm that we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> <unk> <unk> and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
I'm trying to deal with any of a different culture as if I would be my kids, "I want a lot."
I try to deal with all of the different culture as if you were <unk>
So the white in Africa are called <unk> <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face. The little is <unk> written by <unk> who said for about economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, Mr. who opened this conference put a cane on the floor, and he said, we can -- you can -- you can -- you can think of a city that's not <unk>
I decided for the 27 years to just respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start nothing, you never do any other, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? They <unk>
It never comes to a community with an idea, and sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met a cafe. We met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what's going to do you?
The passion that she has for his own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find knowledge because no one in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, and instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not for once, they <unk> but not in <unk> meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with <unk> meetings.
<unk> never <unk> and they will never tell them in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what a chance has been <unk>
So planning has this <unk>
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know about it, because they don't attending their public meetings.
What do we do? We work with one, and we work face-to-face face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You have to create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor, the family physician in the business, who are <unk> with you in your house, at the table of his kitchen -- and that helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a form of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to get away from this <unk> <unk> where we got to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects going, and the government came to me to see how you can do that?
How can I do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
I got <unk>   So the government says, <unk> <unk>  So we've done in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> One of the most successful business <unk> in history, passed away '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before I was involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says "The planning is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the corporate spirit.
So now <unk> <unk> <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to approach with you.
You have to offer for <unk> privacy, has to be fantastic to help and then <unk> will come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we got 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you show you is <unk>
<unk> <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I'm telling you is that entrepreneurship is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution, <unk> fossils <unk> <unk> and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way to sustain <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how we can <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There is no technologies to do that.
Who's going to invent technology for the green revolution, the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
They will be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's an interesting story that I read in a journal <unk> many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> came together with this group of people, and <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York would not exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve, and it <unk> if the population is growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses that would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk>  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty <unk> technology that <unk> New York City.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in 1900, in the United States <unk> <unk> generic companies.
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there is a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer <unk>
Otherwise they won't come with you.
Then, you have to offer an absolute, dedicated service service.
And then I later have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smaller company, the biggest company has to be able to do three things -- <unk> the product you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to have a fantastic <unk> and you have to tell you with a fantastic financial administration.
Guess what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can be doing, selling and search for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked at the 100 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Ford, all the new companies, Google <unk>
There is only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, only one: no one was started by one person.
I never read it, but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't only when it started.
No one starts a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment in <unk> in bars and their dedicated dedicated dedicated people who will for you, what someone did for this <unk> who is talking about this <unk> somebody who will ask you, What will it?
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, you can see it, you can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." <unk> which is looking for <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
<unk> around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't know a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years I've been trying to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much are my neighbors on their <unk>
How can we lend and borrow more things without calling the door at a bad moment?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share our hopes for the cows stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New York, and I'm in love in love with New <unk>
My soul is always relief with the giant <unk> that give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It has always pointing the music.  There's a head in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the most American <unk>
I live close to this house, and I thought it could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and <unk>
And this was a profound gratitude for time to live and <unk>
It gave her to the significant things in my life today.
But I <unk> to keep this look in my everyday life.
I think it's easy to let me catch up the day and forgetting the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this house that was left on a giant <unk> and painted on her phrases to <unk> "Before he died <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and sharing personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was <unk> and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I died, I want to be <unk>  Before I die -- I want to sit on the line of <unk>
Before I died, I want to sing for millions of people.
Before I died, I want to plant a <unk>
Before I died, I want to live outside the <unk>
Before I died, I want to <unk> once more."
Before I died, I want to go to rescue rescue.
Before I died, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hope of people made me laugh at me, and they gave me solace in difficult times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it is about giving the reflection and <unk> and remembering what is the most important thing for us as we grow and we change ourselves.
This happened last year and started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center we did a kit and now have been made walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we proved the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our <unk> era, it's more important than ever before, to find the ways of preserving the perspective and to remember that life is short and delicate lives.
<unk> is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that become more power.
And thinking about death -- our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what we care as individuals and as a community and more media to share hope, fears and stories, the people around us cannot help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce my brothers.
<unk> is 22 years old, and very <unk>
We don't talk about, but it transmits joy than some of the best <unk>
<unk> knows what love.
It shares something that would happen.
It's not <unk> You don't look at color color.
You don't care about religious differences and note about this: Never <unk>
When singing the songs of our childhood, trying to speak words that I couldn't even <unk> it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel She's 16 years old. He's very hot.
They <unk> the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year that every one of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we maintained when I was four years old, I pee in my arm during the first episode of <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
Isn't that <unk>
But most people don't.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of normal society, they are often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although they don't consider them within the <unk> that could only mean one thing: which was <unk> <unk> and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes the physical skills.
In every single individual manifests itself in a different way, from there to be so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, you're being diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the developing development disorders in the world, there's no cause or cure themselves.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was only three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited about having a new self to be in my life.
When they spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play as the other babies and in fact, didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in her own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the car in line around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat anything that would be <unk>
As they grew up, they became more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> then there was something really <unk> a pure and innocent nature -- a child who saw the world without <unk> a human being had never <unk>
<unk> <unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, times when I wish that they were just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that I would not want to change for normal.
<unk> happens by high the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that any one is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and to Sam and you, it would be that you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences you <unk> They're a <unk> Every one of us has a gift in your inner and frankly, the search for normal, is the ultimate <unk>
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies at the time when we try to be like others.
Please please don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what has been to be <unk> in the <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a communications teacher, and I took a kind of communication to student engineering.
I was scared.  <unk> really <unk> from these students with his great minds and his big books and his great words words.
But when those kinds of conversations, I felt what <unk> must have felt like when he fell through the hole of the rabbit and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt that when I had those conversations with the students, I really surprised the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great deal.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are attacking our biggest challenges from energy to the environment and health care and care of health, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that you can see that his science is sexy and that engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us that we study <unk> but we study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing your science, care with <unk>
The slang is a obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same as making it <unk>
Instead, as Einstein said, that everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without engaging with ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, and stories and analogies are ways of <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And by presenting their work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Did you have asked why they're called <unk>  What do they do <unk> bullets are killed by <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but is that it's supported too much in the area of our brain and <unk> us.
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special design structure is so strong that it really inspired the only design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple sentence -- that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then you provide graphics that will be <unk> to our other senses, and they create a deeper sense of understanding of what you can get.
I think these are just some keys that can help others open the door and look at the country of wonders which is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from the entire <unk> <unk> is <unk>
Just because it sounds very good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was a <unk> editor of the 19th century, that he defined it much better when he said, "A <unk> is the one who seeks a public <unk> no matter <unk> <unk> or principle, and that when he wins, he <unk> it was the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
One thing to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to attempt to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words they were saying in the <unk> chamber.
And all of this was thanks to the bravery of a guy with the unusual name of <unk> <unk> who faced the <unk>
They came up on the Tower of London and <unk> but he had enough courage to cope with them, and at the end he had such a popular support in London I won.
And just a few years later we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> so <unk> <unk> like the <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It's not. It's because of a freedom of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all kinds of suggestions that might have <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> of the U.S. <unk> <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was <unk> quality.
And not even with it, they were <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected by King for a given term.
And I could have <unk>
The whole world got tired of the world <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the day of a poor <unk> and I always <unk> with this <unk>
What caused <unk> and <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to be <unk> of power.
They didn't want to call it if he would give him or her <unk> ideas.
So they wanted to give him the most <unk> <unk> and more unfortunate title that came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invented the title.
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> but it was really a trivial degree.
And so the Senate <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treaties and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who would take a serious title, and insignificant as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate doesn't <unk>
We can learn three interesting things from all this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I could figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> by the President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to keep there waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible that we keep waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important, and this is what I want to suggest to you, is that the title of President of America doesn't sound so modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 <unk> nuclear warheads at <unk> the largest economy in the world and a fleet of aerial vehicles and so on.
Reality and story have influenced by the title of <unk>
So at the end, I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was an <unk> at the time.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So, in the end, the Senate won and the House of <unk> <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that they're now President <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to <unk>
The politicians try to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but really, really changes a lot more the words than what they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 feet under land in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is <unk> heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of bodies <unk> in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that they talk about, but mostly that cacophony of <unk> <unk> and stones with <unk> tools.
Like everybody else, I take a <unk> <unk> light strapped onto my head with this rubber rubber <unk> and I can barely distinguish the branches that they hold on the walls of that hole in that <unk> hole that fall hundreds of feet on the ground.
And my hand was <unk> and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met days before, who lost the control and dropped countless feet in that well.
As I talk to you today, these men are deep at that hole at the top of their lives without the <unk> and often, they dying.
I went out of that hole, and I went home, but they might never will.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries, in six continents and 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the Peace <unk>
Among all the incredible people I met there, I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO who has been engaged to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not in the grade.
When we ended up talking to me very <unk> I was honestly trying to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He got me <unk> his stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and I offer my help.
So my journey to the modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
Some of them, I even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> dirty dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people <unk> in the world.
It's twice the number of displaced Africans during all of the slave slave <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a slave slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of a <unk> of the <unk>
However, today you can enslave entire families for generations for <unk> dollars for <unk>
<unk> slavery generates over over about 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many of you have been <unk> with <unk> promises of good education and better work to then discover that they're forced to work without pay, under threat to violence and they can't escape.
Today slavery operates in the <unk> the existing goods produced by slaves are value, but those who produce these are disposable <unk>
It exists in almost everybody in the world, and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange and <unk> show was like entering the old Egypt or <unk>
<unk> in an temperature of 54 degrees -- men, women, children, in fact, families -- in fact, entire families -- <unk> in a heavy <unk> <unk> stack bricks in their head, until 18 at the time, and they take them from the blast <unk> to trucks that are hundreds of meters.
<unk> for <unk> and tiredness work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee <unk> not to eat, and to drink, and severe <unk> made me pee quite <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too warm in the way, and I stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and, sitting there, I thought, my camera gets a much better treatment better than these people.
Back in <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> don't do it. Don't do it here."
And it explained to me that I will demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I wasn't a citizen of that country.
I could put them into an worst situation that they were already gone.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and to work within the system for their release and he trusted the <unk>
As soon as I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found the kids <unk> stones for miles of <unk> land and trucks they were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the children who would charge the kids and the children <unk> their heads <unk> <unk> made of <unk> strings and <unk>
It's hard to see something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 -- 17 hours per day without <unk> because this has been so much their life.
They have nothing with what <unk>
When these villagers <unk> his freedom, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
When you hear the word <unk> we often think of sexual trafficking, and because of this global awareness of the world that would be difficult to me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I gave myself women who had been previously <unk> sex.
I was led to a <unk> <unk> which gave me this dirty basement of <unk> light <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was rather a restaurant.
<unk> as they're known in the craft, they are local to forced prostitution, forced prostitution, <unk>
They have small rooms and private rooms where the <unk> would have their girls and children, some of them just seven years just seven years -- are forced to <unk> customers and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided through a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse by their clients.
From foot in the <unk> I remember feeling a <unk> acute fear of that, and in that moment, I could barely imagine what was stuck in that hell.
I only had a <unk> the stairs where they were born.
There were no doors of <unk>
There was no windows of big enough to <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because we touch a very difficult topic to point out that slavery even sexual trafficking, is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people <unk> in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as a sex slave day.
It is everywhere, but we don't see it.
textiles are another activity that often associate with labor <unk>
I went to Indian villages in which there were entire families in the trade of silk.
This is a family.
The black <unk> hands are the father, the blue <unk> and red, of her children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to <unk> but <unk> is toxic.
My performer told me his stories.
"We have no <unk> they said.
We still hope yet to be able to get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children <unk> in Lake Volta, the greatest artificial lake in the world.
When we got there, I went through a quick look.
I saw what it seemed to be a fishing family on a boat, two brothers, some younger children, some younger kids, right?
<unk> They were all <unk>
Children are separated from their families and <unk> and forced to work <unk> on these boats in the lake, even though we don't know swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling to water.
The branches of the trees immersed in Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, <unk> and fear of <unk> is thrown out of water to unlock the branches.
A lot of <unk>
Since remember, it has always been forced to work in the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to flee and, as all life has been treated with <unk> <unk> it is about the younger slaves under their seat.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they were the last networks, but they had been working from the one in a <unk>
<unk> and <unk>
And it would point out that these networks are spending more than 400 pounds when they're loaded with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a fishermen.
I met him in a refuge where the <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes symbolizes the possible.
Who will be because somebody decided to make the difference in your life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with partners from <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with their bike, and he was suddenly sped up and <unk> our car and touched the window.
He asked us to take it through a dirt road to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we would get rid of the car, and he asked the driver to come out very quickly.
And then pointed out this path barely visible and said, "This is the way, this is the path.
As we started to go down, we took the <unk> that <unk> the path and after walking around about an hour we found out that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of pictures about my head as I <unk> in these water to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> path ended up in one of course, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a soccer field, and they were all full of workers.
Many women had children strapped onto their backs and as they were looking for gold <unk> in <unk> water.
The <unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a pump in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump were <unk> on their own sweat.
I remember watching her eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
So the pits have to be 90 feet and these people carry with heavy stone bags that then will be <unk> to another area where they <unk> the stone to be able to extract the gold.
In the first sight, the site seems to be full men and <unk> but if you look closer, we see the <unk> we see the least fortunate, and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> is going to end up like this victim of T.B. and <unk> for <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died he took him to work with him in the mines.
When her uncle, she was <unk> his debt of uncle who force him to be a slave in the mines.
When I met him, I had worked in the <unk> mines and the leg injury that you see here is a product of a crash in the <unk> so serious that doctors were saying that I should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet, to that, is forced to work on night and day in that mine.
Still, he dreams with being liberated and educated with the help of local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, of <unk> to a remote possibility that inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to shine a light over slavery.
Did you know that your images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we will give testimony to them and make everything possible to help change their lives.
<unk> I think if we can see ourselves each other as human beings, then it's very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. These images are real, real people, like you and me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that I happen to not think about these so many beautiful people, <unk> that I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope these images come up with a force where you see them, in people like you, and I hope that that force will turn on a fire and that fire <unk> light about slavery because without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I'm doing the applied math and there is a peculiar problem for whom the <unk> are like the management,
No one knows what the heck we do.
So today, I will try to explain to you what I do.
<unk> is one of the most human activities.
We <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and the dancers of <unk> --  that we'll see later on.
But the ballet demand is a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of dexterity and probably some <unk> <unk> that can well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's disease, destroy this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his time, was a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In the last few years we've made a lot of progress on the treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need objective tools to detect the disease before it is too late.
We need to be able to measure the progress of an objective and ultimately the only way we will know if there really exists a cure to be when we have an objective and objective <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of movement are not <unk> so they don't use blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological exam in 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that out of clinical trials, you never do it. Never been done.
What if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic -- what if patients could do the exam <unk>
It wouldn't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the clinical clinic.
So what I want to give you to you with is not a conventional way to try, you see, in some sense at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the <unk> <unk>
It shows someone healthy as it emits the sounds of talking, and we can imagine that as dancers of a vocal <unk> because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and all of us have the genes for the <unk> for example.
And like <unk> requires an extraordinary training.
Let's think about time that takes a child to learn to speak.
And from sound, we can track the position of vocal cords as they <unk> and as well as Parkinson's disease affects the <unk> also affects the <unk> organs.
On the bottom of the bottom you can see an example of the <unk> <unk>
We see the same <unk>
<unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these exams based on the voice with clinical clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they're both using existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
Both of them are <unk> OK, but the <unk> examinations are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They're very quickly, they take about 30 seconds as a lot.
It's <unk> and we all know what happens is happening.
When something happens to be turned on to a cost so <unk> it comes to mass scale.
These are some incredible goals for <unk>
We can reduce the <unk> difficulties of patients.
I would not need to go to the clinic for <unk> routine.
<unk> monitoring we could get objective data.
We could make a <unk> mass cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it's too late.
So by giving you the first steps in that sense, we are launching the Women's <unk> Initiative <unk>
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start addressing these targets.
We have local <unk> accessible to about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no Parkinson's, I can call low price and leave recordings for about cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've had six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So I <unk> taking all these samples of, say 10,000 people, you can say who's healthy and who not?
What would you get from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate whether you have no disease or not the disease.
<unk> You see, some people may not <unk> you may not <unk>
But we're going to get a very big sample of data in different circumstances, and to do it in different circumstances, it's important because we're looking at <unk> the factors of confusion in search of real markers of disease.
TR: Do you have a accuracy accuracy at this moment?
<unk> much more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to <unk> has done a fantastic job and now has shown that it works in the mobile phone network also, what we <unk> the project. We have a 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We're <unk> <unk>
We <unk> in the dark, in no windows without windows and large, we avoid sunlight.
We do the thin models -- even more <unk> the perfect skin -- so much more <unk> we do the impossible and <unk> it in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with many years of experience and a taste of the images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that was happening in Japan.
Soon after that, an organization where it was <unk> <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't sit at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected the wave.
The water level recorded over 24 feet tall and over three miles the inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
We take debris from channels and <unk>
<unk> schools.
We took tons and tons of fish -- dead fish -- <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> of photos and cameras and <unk>
Everybody did the same thing.
<unk> and take them to different places from the villages around <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented an enormous part of personal losses that people had <unk>
As we went from the <unk> and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
I helped clean the <unk> <unk> enormous, gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the <unk> center -- the photos.
There were the <unk> and I had the honor of that day to <unk> me to clean up the photos.
And this was exciting and <unk> I had heard of expression beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I was going to go through myself my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the photos, I found some that had more than a hundred years old, some were still in the lab, I couldn't stop thinking about how to fix that <unk> how to fix that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same.
So that night, I went into Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive -- that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had to get to get it very accurately and <unk>
Otherwise that little girl wouldn't have the aspect of it, and that would be as tragic as I have the photo <unk>
With the step of time, they got very lucky and more pictures and they took more <unk> this is that he entered Facebook and <unk> and five days later, 80 people from 12 countries was offered to help.
After two weeks I had 150 people <unk>
In Japan, in July, we would be fascinated by a neighbor of the north of <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the <unk> libraries that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story, dependent by the photos.
It could be an hour, it could be a <unk>
It could be a <unk>
This <unk> had to draw in pretty much hand using a guide areas and the areas that had no <unk>
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures <unk> in saltwater, covered in bacteria, with seaweed, even oil, all of that together with the step of time, I continue to <unk> it was an important part of the project.
We couldn't afford the picture unless it was clean -- dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We have a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm the photos of the <unk>
As I once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was lucky to the photos.
He had begun to <unk> her, but he stopped realizing that the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and his own face would not have been able to <unk> we were able to <unk> the images in a single photo and put it out the full picture.
When I picked up their pictures shared something from his history with us.
Some colleagues in his husband found the photos in a fire station, between the rubble far away from where he used to be their house, but his colleagues would <unk>
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Their young children, not so small now, but their two children were in school in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took him a week to find his whole family and know that everyone had survived.
The day I gave him his photographs her son, lower son, <unk>
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift that he could <unk> something that he could look at, something that I could remember from the past he hadn't been labeled in the day of March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined up to <unk> hundreds of them helped us clean up with more than <unk> photos -- the great <unk> -- the great majority came into the hands of their <unk>
Over 500 volunteers around the world helped us back back to 90 families and hundreds of pictures completely <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend more than a thousand dollars in equipment and materials, most ink to <unk>
We take all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, one thing, one or somebody wanted.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would get, but the first thing that we would take to look for.
And this was what the project was trying to restore little pieces of humanity, to return to someone their connection to the past.
When a picture is coming back to somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person that you get.
This project also made a big difference in the <unk> life.
Some of them connected to something larger, to give back something, using their talent for something that won't be thin skin <unk>
To finish this email I would like to read this email -- I emailed it on the day I came back from Japan after six months.
While <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a picture of women of different ages from the grandmother to the small child, <unk> around a baby, <unk> me because a very similar picture of my grandmother my grandmother, my mother, my mother, my <unk> <unk> on our wall.
In the whole world, in all the few of our basic needs are the same. Right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> <unk> inspired us and awe and curious about this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple on an exhibition of just a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of technique -- a new technique that can create the slow motion of the light in motion.
And with that we can create cameras that can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or to see inside of the body without using X-rays, and really challenging the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch on it and put it into a <unk> <unk> in a number of <unk> creating a <unk> package just a millimeter wide size.
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a <unk>
If you take that bullet and this package of photons and shoot on this bottle, how do those photons spread into this <unk>
What is the sound of the light in the <unk>
Now, all of this --  -- remember, all this is true in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light in motion.
Coca-Cola, I don't <unk> this research.  <unk> many things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a package of photons that starts to <unk> and that, inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light goes down to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally arrive at the lid and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's an air bubble.
In that time, the waves go down the table and because of the insights of the top you see in the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights would be <unk>
Now, if we take a <unk> <unk> and we make it <unk> the same distance and we see it in slow motion to about 10 billion times, how much they think it would take us to see that film?
A day? A week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring movie, of a <unk> <unk> movement.
And how about testing it with <unk>
You can see the waves that were <unk> from the table, the tomato and the wall of the background.
It's like throwing a rock on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of life.
But if you look at this more and more of this <unk> you'll notice that, as the light <unk> on tomato <unk> is still bright.
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces inside his inside and goes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and verify if the fruit is grown up without having to <unk>
What do we create this camera at the India?
Like photographers, you know, if we take a picture to the <unk> exposure, very little light.
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than the shortest picture, so I just will come into some light.
<unk> that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those data <unk> and <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all these data in raw and <unk> in an interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible,
And if a new power of a superhero future would allow you to see after <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You will go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
where we could extract those multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We've already built it.
On the left, is our <unk>
Behind the wall is a dummy and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will return to the camera -- but curiously, at slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works like this, our <unk> has unique <unk>
It has very good time resolution, and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also to the hidden things, but we don't know what point it corresponds to how a distance.
By projecting a laser -- you can record a <unk> picture, which you see on the screen, really doesn't make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, we <unk> and we'll try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we'll be able to see the <unk> object.
Can we see <unk>
This is our reconstruction of it.
We have things to explore before we take this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> <unk> with what's around the curve, which is around the box.
Or we could find survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at light in the open windows of the open.
Or could we build <unk> <unk> capable of looking at the interior of the body, <unk> <unk> and the same for the <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and blood this is quite difficult, so this is actually a request to scientists so that you start thinking about <unk> as a new manufacturing system to solve the problems of health <unk> on the next generation.
Just like <unk> <unk> him a scientist, I became a science in art, an art of photographs of it.
And I realized that all the <unk> data that we collect every time are not just for scientific visualization, but we can do that.
It creates a new form of computational photography with slow motion and code code.
And let's look at those <unk> Remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few <unk> of a second.
But here's something that's fun.
If we look at the waves underneath the <unk> these are going out of us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange Einstein -- I would have loved this image.
The order in which the events occur in the world sometimes appears to the camera.
<unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can fix this <unk>
That's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my cell phone.
A mobile phone can change life, and it gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone, a crime crime in Syria.
With a mobile phone you can tweet a message and initiate a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can actually record a song, and then you can go to <unk> and famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> in 1984 and I live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this town.
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are going to look for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people are <unk> to look for a change, had a cell phone in your pocket.
Who would you have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's a lot. Almost everybody has a cell today.
But today I'm going to talk about me, from my mobile, and how life changed me.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the E.U. Commission presented a <unk>
<unk> <unk> of <unk>
This directive says that every European <unk> company, every single Internet provider has to store a wide range of information data.
Who calls whom who sends an email to <unk>
Who gives you one text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile, where we are.
All of this information is stored by at least six months, and to two years, in your phone company, or their Internet <unk>
And all over Europe stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the telephone and Internet providers -- all of this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some even said this would be <unk> <unk>
The <unk> was the secret police of Eastern <unk>
And I also asked myself if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time you use your <unk>
So I asked my phone for my phone -- <unk> <unk> who at that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, and I would tell you all the information you had about me.
I asked them once, and I got them back to ask, and I didn't get a particular answer. It was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to give you a lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end of the end, it agreed.
I promise the demand and they send me the information I <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> Court failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly thing about brown on a <unk> inside.
And at the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> <unk>
At first I saw them and I said, well, it's a huge file. Okay.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step at night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this <unk> information.
I want to make it <unk>
Because I want to show people what the retention of data.
So, along with <unk> <unk> and Open Data City, we did this.
This is a <unk> visualization of my life.
You can zoom in, and you can go back and forth.
You can see every step I give you.
And you can see how I'm going from <unk> to <unk> and how often I call it the way.
All of this is possible with this information.
That's a little scary.
But it's not just me.
It's all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, we talk a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then one calls the other, and then we end up with this big communications network.
You can see how your people communicate to each other to what time they call each other, what time you sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who he speaks to who, who sends an email sending an email to who, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at first, imagine if all of these people on the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a cell phone in our pocket.
And the <unk> had known who was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who were the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And as a result, neither of the <unk> of <unk>
Because today the state agencies want to store as much information from us as possible within the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and want to play them forever.
But the <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for your self-determination.
You have to fight for that every day.
When they go home, tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and it's not very <unk>
When you go home, tell her representative that just because business agencies and state agencies can store some information, you don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones to give them to remember that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me into the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have brain palsy, so that I would take you all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
<unk> <unk> is not genetics.
It's not <unk> no <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were brothers, although they are.
It's just about accidents, like which happened to birth.
Now, I'm not a source of inspiration. And I don't want any of the present to you.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, we wish it was a disabled thing.
Let's go for a ride.
<unk> <unk> are in the shopping center, you drive in search of parking spaces, and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled places.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
And I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. <unk> is only one of them.
There is a <unk> of the <unk> I won the gold medal.
I am a <unk> Muslim woman, and I woman live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, you might be able to do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my disease had the same <unk>
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I can.
A lot of people <unk> cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters <unk> I <unk>
If my three older sisters went to public school, my parents were going to go to the school system and <unk> that I would also be out of the ultimate <unk> and if we didn't take all the maximum note that I would all <unk> my mother.
My father taught me how to walk at the age of five years putting my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another approach that I used was to hang up a dollar in front of me to get it to it.
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong.
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten kindergarten was walking like a <unk> <unk> who's received a lot of <unk>
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there's 20 Arabic now, and they're still all of the family.  I think no one realized we were not <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> as a slogan of campaign.
The people I grew up with a problem with my faith.
But nevertheless, it looked like a lot of hunger from starvation during the <unk>
I would tell you that he had enough fat to live three months without eating without eat, so <unk> the dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yeah, in <unk> That's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends wear <unk> I am too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer summer on the coast of Jersey, I wasn't going.
I would spend my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we weren't going to Palestine to Palestine all of the <unk> we would get in <unk>
On summer holidays often my father was about <unk> so I would drinking milk from <unk> and I would put me warm cups on the back, I sat down in the <unk> Sea and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But the miraculous cure was yoga.
I must say it's very boring, but before I do yoga it was a comedian <unk> I could not stand up <unk>
And now I can put it in my head.
My parents <unk> this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital Hospital.
I went to college through the <unk> of positive discrimination and I got a grant to the University of Arizona, and I was in all the <unk>
It was like the pet <unk> of the theater.
Everybody <unk>
I did all the most intelligent tasks I took out the maximum note in my lectures, and also in their classes.
Every time I did a scene from the <unk> <unk> my <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to do a piece called <unk> very slow to Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with cerebral palsy,
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at four <unk> At the end of four <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of them, they finally <unk>
Thank God <unk> I finally am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  You gave him <unk>
I went to <unk> running to the head of the theater, crying historically, as if somebody had killed my cat, ask me why and she told me that he couldn't make the stunt scenes.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do <unk> you can't do the <unk> either.
It was a role for the one that was literally born and gave an actor without the brain.
College was mimicking my life.
Hollywood has a story of <unk> actors without disability for disabled papers.
And I went back home, and my first tour <unk> was kind of extra <unk>
My dream came true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> he didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Just <unk> to perfect people.
But there were exceptions to rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
At my first tour, I took comics famous from New York to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedian that took when he fell to the realization that he was going to be at high speed on the New Jersey New Jersey that had a brain <unk>
I worked in L.A. all the United States, and also in Arabic, in the Middle East, no <unk> <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know that you never heard that little unpleasant <unk> that says women are not fun, and they're quite fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> Festival in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and the time to remind the directors that <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs were much easier to fight the challenge of stigma <unk>
My big opportunity came in 2010.
I was invited to be invited to the news program. It has behind with Keith <unk>
I walked into a graduate dance, I went to a study and sat down in a <unk> wheelchair.
I looked at the head and I said, "You can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I was clinging to the speaker desk to not get out of the screen during the <unk> and when the interview ended up the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't come back to me.
But not just Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I stayed like full-time <unk> and <unk> my chair.
It's a fun thing that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
The kids are <unk> but they never <unk> from me or a child or older.
All of a sudden, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
I would see clips online with <unk> like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist.
What disease does you have?
We really should pray for her."
A <unk> suggested even to add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If somebody in a wheelchair can't do <unk> then you can't make someone in a wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> <unk>
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors were saying not <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, having grown up with media, I don't think we <unk>
I hope we could create more positive images of disability in media and everyday lives.
Maybe there were more positive images, that's less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
We even need all the society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> of <unk> Susan <unk> and the infamous <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world. <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> in the <unk> state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity to give children Syrian refugees -- a little bit of what my parents would tell me.
It was the only time my father saw me teaching me live, and I read this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a boy of a young people.
I don't know their name, but I know their story.
She lives in a small village to the South <unk>
This village is near <unk>
<unk> drives the small town to poverty and on the edge of the <unk>
Without anything for him there, it goes to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When you get there, there are no opportunities, there is no work, no longer ones in the future.
He just lived in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe one year is <unk>
And one day he was about a guy who gives you it to take it to <unk> after dinner for dinner, to <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
He gets a little bit of money to buy a new money to send home to your family.
They present a young guy.
She turned home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts a bomb.
That boy in that little village with dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist and that dynamic group of people were to <unk> an connected terrorist organization with al Qaeda.
So how did the story of a little people in a little town trying to pursue their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, waiting for the future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that arrived.
This was the first thing that got him out of what we call "the <unk>
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young people who were <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity for jobs, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth who suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people living in cities are going to be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if you don't give them opportunities, the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door to terrorism, to violence, to <unk> will be the history of cities.
And in my hometown of birth, 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, it's not going to school.
They're not doing nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital.
I remember being in front of that hospital <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I'd seen me forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support a few youth leaders at a business earth.
<unk> about 90 juvenile leaders.
We sat down and we had a rainwater of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, because it was a university university student, was the perfect white <unk> for Al <unk> and other civil organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to come from point A to B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle. It can be the easiest way of <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a company of <unk>
He started <unk> they went to local residents who they normally couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of her family and friends, and his dream is at some time to expand hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story do?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit, and I think entrepreneurship can be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking so <unk>
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people on the summit of corporate initiative and how they can be innovative and how to create a culture of business <unk>
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until a little bit, until Mohamed wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic from overseas.
If you <unk> someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers, <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> <unk>
I created a farm outside of <unk> and he started to grow <unk> and <unk> who said they could survive the hard weather of <unk>
And he started the delivery of flowers for wedding creating gardens in the houses, and the companies of the city, and now it's working in the creation of the first public park of <unk> in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where the young people are young, they can go together, and as he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he doesn't <unk> <unk> because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire the young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought to work for an NGO, working for the government, but their history, their innovation, their innovation, actually had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
For the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, inspiring young people and create a culture of corporate entrepreneurship is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need experience and orientation to drive them in development and put them into their business.
<unk> the young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support they need to move from understanding to the creation, and create the <unk> for urban growth.
For me, entrepreneurship is something more than starting a business.
It's creating social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Their Peace Park, this is how it calls it when it is created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired kids from the street to help rent and keep the motorbikes for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape from <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to turn young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and <unk> their <unk> innovation and will have more stories about flowers and <unk> of Peace <unk> and <unk> from <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> my dad in the <unk> <unk> an area <unk> north of the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The <unk> forest.
The sun would make the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not going to be on the way that we would -- we could almost pretend that we were the first human beings on the ground that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a <unk> in a <unk> view of a beautiful lake lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> of about four square feet with apple hearts -- <unk> balls of aluminum balls and old <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to pull out what they had <unk> who they thought I was going to clean their <unk>
That question went on with me, and it was a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how you <unk> or where do you go to the <unk> who cleans our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
So here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean our trash, to the reason for 11 tons of waste and two tons of recyclable products.
I wanted to meet them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who I do that work.
What do you feel to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through their pathways, and I interviewed people in offices and I interviewed people in offices and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I need to be a little bit more.
So I started working as a trash <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I <unk>
And they <unk> the mechanical mechanics and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as common as you believe -- and in the days that it's very strong one will be <unk> quickly.
It costs a lot of getting used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies continued to <unk> the weight of taking over their body tons of garbage every week.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> <unk> collection is one of the most dangerous <unk> of the country, and I learned why.
You're coming out and entering the traffic all the day and goes <unk> around you.
They just want to <unk> so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for <unk>
And also the trash itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck and cause terrible harm.
I also learned about the relentless <unk>
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand the trash is like a force of nature itself.
It never stops coming.
It's also as a form of breathing or circulation.
It must always be in motion.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe that <unk> of waste is the most important piece of work on the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the first license of public health care.
If you don't get rid of the waste in both efficient and effective shape for each day, this starts to <unk> from its container and its dangers inherent to be in very real ways.
We had been controlled for decades and centuries they come back to <unk> and they start <unk>
The economy needs the economy.
If we can't get rid of the old thing, we don't have space for what the drivers of the economy start to fail when you're in danger consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just pointed out their relationship.
And then there is what I call our average speed of life necessary.
So I mean just at the speed of the time that we used to move used at <unk>
We usually don't care about it or <unk> we cleaned or we cleaned up with us our coffee cup -- our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use them -- the <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there is a work force on the other side that will take care of it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about collection collection that might help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're in the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know when to <unk>
And their work allows us to do ours.
They're almost a way of relief.
The flow that keep us against ourselves, our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a collection collection <unk> on the street, grabbed my little son, and I went down the <unk> and there was a man doing his journey from recycled recycled and paper as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that particular day, but I started crying.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be okay."
Shortly after I started to research the collection collection and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we worked together many times and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we have to include and have to count all the costs, even the very real human cost of labor.
<unk> waste is what we think when we talk about trash, it is three percent of the amount of waste from the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic here.
So in the flow of your days and their lives, the next one to see someone whose job is to clean the trash of you, take a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you, thank you.
My work is focused on the connection to think about our community life, forming part of the environment where architecture is naturally in the conditions and traditions of local traditions.
I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in the emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
And they also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a shopping center in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, my team and me, what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to get out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because the <unk> lining is heat in the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city in which this shouldn't happen because it's a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees during the entire year.
And thirdly, it looks like nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a very wealthy place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really <unk> with the old market that is this <unk> structure where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that that was what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a building, of several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge came to the <unk> the site that is located in a very much range of a lot of growth growth, where much of the buildings that we see in the image, not exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of meters.
So the first thing we did was create a connection between these two streets, putting all the entries in the building.
And this spreads with a <unk> <unk> that creates an outdoor space in the building that <unk> by its own shape and the rain and rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes in every floor because of the space form.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that <unk> local temperature conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue that was similar to a concrete <unk> with <unk> to allow the air air to allow the air to the air, but in a <unk> way.
And then we get inspired by these beautiful buttons on the dresses of the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a controlled way inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little color crystals that use the inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it was not easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center. It was not what they <unk>
But finally, we all realized that this idea of the market was much more profitable than the mall because in the end of the mall because in order to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was much more economic -- not just because of the material compared to the glass, but also because you had no necessary <unk>
So we got certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy <unk> for the building in a city in which electricity is cut almost every day.
So we get a big advantage to putting it into the roof.
And then under those panels we think on the ceiling as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, and they collect water for the <unk>
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go for the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to do a project so big, the biggest thing I ever mentioned, needed not just to understand the city of Tunisia, but also to its environment, its tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention into <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a dozen Internet doors connected by lines out of <unk>
When I went to place, the first design operation we did was to expand the streets in existing streets, creating 12 similar blocks of size and features that I have in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some of these strategic points in relation to the idea of the interconnected doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was thinking about the cell, the small cell of the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would the best orientation for an apartment in the climate <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house, and therefore a natural ventilation.
So we <unk> a scheme that claims most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that it's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then on the low plant we have all the connections to <unk>
And it also responds to local standards that make a greater density on higher levels and a lower density in the plant floor.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving back to the community that is busy for construction.
It's where all the neighbors, they can climb and <unk> and make such activities like running a <unk> race in the morning, or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And in addition, they're in emerging countries, where you can see the cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes local communities and local economies at the same rate as the buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have the goal to connect nature to the people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl, I joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had big amounts of hair, very bright hair and a little <unk> <unk> and it was super strong for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
And I ended up that year and I was full of <unk> until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I got a time after the <unk> of the school, I was a little afternoon, and I was <unk> in the bathroom of girls.
When the coast was <unk> I walked into the classroom, I took from my teacher to the <unk>
And then I did.
I would give you the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just a few things.
All the case.  And I set up to give back the book to <unk> but to see, some of my other peers had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all of rows from <unk> and I had a row in the way I was there, because I <unk>
I'm still amazed what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt good at it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It's that it was all <unk> obvious stuff.
I never <unk>
But most of all, I <unk> the reason why I cared about this little <unk> so small to be <unk>
I <unk> jealousy.
They're so mysterious and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
There are also <unk> <unk> are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of <unk> in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> the loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
And so you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the laboratory where we study them in all of their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no <unk> it would be literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> no <unk>
He wouldn't have a <unk> king of the <unk> and a <unk>
There would be no Shakespeare.
<unk> the high school lists of high school because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without <unk> there is no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the <unk> almost all of them.
This year, 100 years of his masterpiece, <unk> for the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> my own, everything we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details <unk> right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think of a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard it is that image.
We forgot about how relentless it is.
I mean, this is books that Virginia <unk> said were as tough as <unk>
I don't know how <unk> <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious like the <unk> which is reduced to the person, their wish, their <unk> are a very good narrative base.
I don't know. I think we get very close to bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel wrong.
But as storytellers as storytellers and audience, we know exactly what details go to <unk> to <unk> the <unk> right?
<unk> make us all <unk> and that's something that I <unk> understood.
All that she does for me to give me pleasure could give the other pleasure to another, perhaps <unk>
And he starts to say that story, and since then, <unk> says that every single charm he <unk> senses on his lover, he adds him to his collection of surgical instruments in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion. You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like the big amounts of brilliant hair, and the cute little <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> from the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> <unk> the <unk> language with jealousy.
When <unk> is in his agony of <unk> he suddenly hears behind the doors and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from an old text interpretation or to look at a <unk>
He says, "They're scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they're searching for knowledge, search of truth -- really painful.
The pain, <unk> <unk> These were the tracks towards wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need to make us suffer, that it causes us to be a range of feelings much more profound and vital than a wise man who can be <unk>
We're telling us that we're going to look for <unk> women.
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> reveal ourselves.
And there is another excitement that makes us open ourselves in this particular way.
Is there any other excitement about us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other excitement that teaches us to look at <unk> intensity so <unk>
Freud would write about it later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very <unk> young man who was being used to the idea that her woman would <unk>
And Freud said that there was something weird in that man who didn't get into what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he did his wife, <unk> <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or maybe accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud says that the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are really good at this.
<unk> described very well how <unk> make us look at <unk> but <unk>
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, the more we become residents of fantasy.
And because of this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent acts of violent or illegal.
<unk> drives us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me in the age of eight, but I'm also thinking about this story I heard about the news.
A <unk> woman of 52 years of age was captured by having created a fake account account at Facebook from which he sent messages to himself, awful to itself, for a year.
For one year, a whole year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his <unk> <unk> I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with awe.
Because, let's be realistic.
How huge -- although <unk> creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character in the American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> who try to do the <unk> of our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of <unk> the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take <unk> her most famous character.
Tom <unk> is going to be <unk> or want what you have to <unk> your self and <unk> from what you ever <unk> and it's under the floor <unk> to your name, takes your <unk> your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> everybody, as much as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live at times jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the coin is <unk> right?
<unk> show us <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when they're not sure, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to <unk> Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about the <unk> curse at Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always been <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> head face of <unk> <unk> which needs <unk> <unk> needs <unk> <unk> but <unk>
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs your help, but they <unk> it and <unk> it in the each one of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> once <unk> <unk> <unk> all with his solution, <unk> back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells you that there is no person in <unk> <unk> who don't want to leave your hand.
It's one of the few times that we see <unk> <unk> in the story. I think this is really mysterious, it's mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem of geometry, no emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute you're on the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> it allows you to admire that idea of being the <unk>
It could still be as simple?
What if <unk> are really a issue of geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to this?
Well, maybe we don't have to <unk> from the greatness of the other.
We can do it with it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we hope that happens, let's remember that we have fiction to <unk>
<unk> <unk> jealousy.
fiction used to <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what he <unk> the sweet <unk> the terrifying the terrifying the <unk> Tom <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and landed on the <unk> Sea.
Armstrong and <unk> were alone, but their presence in the surface of the surface was the culmination of a collective process <unk>
The Apollo program was the bulk of peace in American history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave about 400,000 people and asked about 20,000 companies, universities and universities and government agencies.
People died, including the crew crew 1.
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> <unk> on their surface, of which they were <unk> after death of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do you <unk>
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> kilos of old rocks, and something that the 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is, because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the own words of Kennedy at Rice University in <unk> is given us a better idea.
John F. <unk> <unk> Some ask, why do you <unk>
Why does it turn to our goal?
And you might ask, why scale the mountain <unk>
35 years ago, why fly on <unk>
Why do he play Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and we chose to do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> To the <unk> the Apollo wasn't just a victory victory on the east in the Cold War.
In the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> to the transcendence of the powers of technology.
They were because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon occurred in a context of a long checklist of technological <unk>
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> the <unk> and was removed smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a boat to publish it, but in 1969, the <unk> crew flew 300 miles an hour.
Since 1970, no human being has gone back to the moon.
No one has ever traveled faster than the Apollo crew <unk> and the joyful optimism about the power of technology has been <unk> by seeing that problems that we imagine that technology would solve as going to Mars, create a clean energy, to cure cancer, or feeding the world population seems to have a result of <unk>
I remember seeing the <unk> <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't belong to the <unk> escape from the rocket Saturn by <unk>
I thought this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was absolutely sure that I would see the colonies on Mars.
So that's what happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it over the last two days here, at TED.
It seems like the technologists would have been distracted and enriched with trivial toys, things like <unk> applications and social media, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've <unk> and enriched our lives.
But not <unk> the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation in Silicon Valley, that we <unk> who have created less ambitious companies than <unk> in the years that are <unk> <unk> Microsoft, and Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are <unk> to concrete, the incentives that venture capitalists give the entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused by <unk> creation of ideas by funding to <unk> or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It's mostly going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their high point without worrying about the risk, they preferred small investment investment than they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had trouble investing with the benefit of technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and whose development is in the long term -- they also haven't invested in developing technologies to solve big problems because they don't have a immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we choose not to solve big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars that would require a political decision that was popular and that will never happen.
We don't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things than to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the global energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources like solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar power and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want power of alternative energy sources that can compete at price <unk> They don't exist.
technologists, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists are according to what policy and international treaties -- the development of <unk> energy -- <unk> a significant increase in research and energy development, and some kind of control of the coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we will see an energy energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seem technological, it turns out not to be.
We know for long ago that famines are result of failure in the food <unk>
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis affecting the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like harvest or systems for storage and <unk> but there will be a famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon declared her war in 1971, but we soon discovered that there are many types of cancer, some <unk> <unk> and only over the last 10 years, seem to be found effective and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve the problems with technology.
We can and -- but these four elements have to be <unk> political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, the institutions have to support the <unk> it should be able to be able to understand it, and we should understand it.
The mission <unk> which has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it meets those criteria.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no competition <unk> like the Cold War, there's not a politician like John Kennedy that <unk> the hard and the dangerous thing, and there's no popular science mythology fiction like exploring the solar system.
In general, going to the moon it turned out to be simple.
It was only three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Now, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start <unk> ideas that are about trust.
They're so common that they have become <unk> of our society.
I think they're three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a huge decline of trust, it's a very widespread <unk>
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover the trust.
I think that <unk> the goal and the task is <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you about today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives you a very clear idea about it.
First of all, why people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
It makes me bow down to think that there may have come down in some activities or institutions and that might have increased in others.
I don't have that clear.
But I can turn to opinion polls and opinion polls are supposed to be the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion polls over time, there's no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, follow the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago are still a lot of <unk> and they are still <unk>
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost just halfway down.
But is this evidence for enough?
What opinion polls are, of course, views.
What else can you <unk>
What you see is the <unk> attitudes that people are doing when they ask certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody was telling you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> on the <unk> teachers.
I probably would ask you to ask, "What do you ask for?"
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust you, but in other no."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust <unk>
We don't assume that the confidence that we're going to feel for a certain kind of <unk> official or a person, it's going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for instance, say I trust a certain grade teacher that I know to give the kind of reading, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we stop the whole knowledge when we think about trust in more <unk>
I think surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real confidence, because they are trying to <unk> their good judgment of the way of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
I think it's a stupid goal.
It's not that the goal I <unk>
I would encourage you to have more confidence in what it is, of trust, but not what it isn't.
Ultimately, I am a <unk> of not trusting what it's not reliable.
And I think that those people who <unk> their savings with the very rightly called Mr. <unk> which then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, yes, it was too <unk>
Having more confidence is not an intelligent goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, it says, yeah, yeah, OK, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about to do is a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that one person is competent in the <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worth <unk>
But if, on the contrary, they're not accountable. We couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are competent and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the <unk> because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see that they will <unk> their own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I don't have a lot of friends that I don't have a lot of friends who are competent and responsible for but extremely <unk>
If it's like that, I still haven't <unk>
But that's what we're going to be <unk> to say before we trust.
Trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've tried to build responsibility systems for all sorts of institutions, professional professionals, and so forth, that we make us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you see the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> than going <unk>
And we find the same problem in all of our public life, and we found that the accountability system that is destined to ensure <unk> and testing tests actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of the people who have to do difficult tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> the <unk> as we say.
I'm sure you all know the similar examples.
And they <unk> all of that, for the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if you think about being trustworthy.
It's not easy. It's the <unk> simple actions, you <unk> what you don't really do properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> the task to rebuild the trust, puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve the trust.
But the trust, in short, it's signature because they give us other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the bases enough to be able to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't afford it by the large, all the people, all the time.
But you also have to do some evidence that you are worthy of confidence.
How do you do it?
That's a day now, everywhere, it makes the ordinary people, <unk> institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks says I can <unk> without <unk>
I take you and get my money back and get them back for the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good test that you're worthy of trust, and you have trust what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think what we're saying is not very difficult to <unk>
What people rely on is in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is <unk>
Thank you.
Since the beginning of computers we've been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen in which the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been increasingly <unk> more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> <unk> and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I hadn't <unk>
I started imagining how I <unk>
I first created this tool that goes into the digital space, so when the strong <unk> against the screen transfers its physical body to <unk>
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool break down the barriers.
But the two hands remain still outside the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using all the dexterity of your hands?
In the division of Science <unk> with Microsoft, with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
<unk> a transparent bombsight with cameras to detect the fingers and the face, you can now lift the hands of the keyboard, getting into the inside of 3D space and grab the pixels right with your hands.
Like the windows and archives have a location in real space, <unk> it's as easy as a <unk> book <unk>
You can flip through the book and highlight <unk> or words with the direct touch sensor that there are down on every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we're feeding in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come up to us?
<unk> many of us would have bought and returned things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision you get from a device mounted on your head or <unk> when the system is understanding the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how we can make them make a physicists so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, that we create this only physical <unk>
This imam <unk> behaving as a 3D pixel in space, which means that as much computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this tiny, three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control movement through a combination of levitation and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And in programming the object, we released it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and <unk> and stay forever in the physical world.
You can teach physically and physically and the distance of Michael Jordan, you can reproduce as a physical reality of physics that we want to.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and unlike the monitors or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what is more fascinating to change the computer physics is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities.
As you see, digital information is not just going to show you something but to begin to act directly on us as part of the physical world around us without that we have to <unk> our world.
So we started talking today about a barrier, but if we <unk> that barrier, the only limit it's our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China in the 1960s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to go to a school for athletes with all expenses <unk>
But my tiger mother, he said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution -- they believed firmly that there was just an <unk> path towards <unk> a safe and safe job.
No matter whether the job would like or not.
But my dream was a Chinese singer singer <unk>
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of school and the host of a radio show.
But no adult beat him the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
All my friends <unk> me but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream never <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life a second class of happiness was the only thing you might aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one around me wanted to <unk> OK.
I gave books to books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I came to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books to do here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese Chinese life.
And it's not <unk> <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but <unk>
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I told myself, "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to come out of this <unk> guilt trap, and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The meeting with a new culture also led to my <unk> <unk>
<unk> a lot of perspectives.
For example, at first this map seemed to me outside the place because this is what students in China learn.
It had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map means the perspective of people.
<unk> <unk> not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are all sorts of research fields like <unk> comparative and Palestinian literature.
<unk> and <unk> gives academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading was working for research, why not do it as well as <unk>
So I started reading books from two.
You can be <unk> <unk> by Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> <unk> are political economic and spiritual economic logic.
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> <unk>
If you know another language is also fun to read your favorite books, in two languages.
<unk> <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
For instance, this is through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> mother."
The books opened me up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to come back or feeling <unk> never.
Having a dream <unk> it's nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that sharing is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams come from, where the passion is coming out of happiness.
<unk> <unk> can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named Alex.
Alex entered the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> <unk> on my office and took off the shoes and told me that I wanted to talk about her problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My class had a <unk> as a first client.
And I got a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought it could drive it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the <unk> was made easy to just move my head while they would get the solution.
<unk> the new <unk> said Alex, and so I looked at it, she was right.
You start to work on, it got home later, it has children later, until death goes later.
For <unk> as Alex and I had plenty of time.
But shortly afterwards, my <unk> <unk> was <unk> to Alex to Alex who would talk about their life <unk>
I <unk>
I said, "Yes, he's coming out with guys under his category, you <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like it was to marry me.
And then my <unk> <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe you get <unk> with the next.
Furthermore, the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before they <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they <unk> but it didn't make the honor of Alex to be a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex to be the perfect time, and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of benign <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for race careers, and the future <unk> all over the place.
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think no one gets to the age of age.
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, yeah. It's amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> they take your dream a <unk> I want to see. All the <unk> really matter.
This is not just my view. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be 35 years old.
This means eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and experiences that give your life to your life have gone past when you have 30 and <unk>
<unk> people in the '40s, not <unk>
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race have an impact on the amount of money that we <unk>
We know more than half of the Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in its <unk> and <unk> to <unk> which means if there's something you want to change themselves, now it's the time to change themselves.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than in any other time in life, and we know that the female fertility goes to their top for 28 and things become complicated to the <unk>
The <unk> are the time to <unk> over their body and their choices.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years is critical for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment where your daily life and common life has an impact on the person who <unk>
But what we don't hear often is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the timeline of adulthood.
The researchers call them a <unk> adolescence called <unk>
The journalists <unk> <unk> names like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines adulthood.
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not right?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> on your head and say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and nothing happens.
And then every day, <unk> really interesting as you or your kids and your children arrive at my office and say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship is not <unk> I'm not killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that as I start a career before the 30, everything will be right."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
He had better test that day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the <unk>
They were all running, but then at some point around the 30, he turned the music and everybody started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would be standing, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he was <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit end, but it's not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for <unk> there's a huge pressure to the <unk> and so many of you start a career, choosing a city, choosing a couple, and have two kids in a much more short period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there's some research that start to show -- which is much harder and stressful to do all of the <unk>
The middle age crisis is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the race you want now.
<unk> realize you can't have the son you want to now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> look at themselves, and me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was I doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because it was, in his own words, having an identity crisis.
He said he would like to work in art or in entertainment, but you could still not decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend, which showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living a very difficult time, his earlier life, had been even more difficult.
They were often often in our <unk> but then she woke up with her, "You don't choose your family, but he can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma came his head on his legs and he cried for almost every hour.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent the whole morning <unk> with his many <unk> but then she stood up watching the empty space that was following the emergency room -- please call <unk>
I was about the <unk> when he saw me and he said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who's going to take care of me if I give me <unk>
At that time, I took a lot of work to resist and I don't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that really <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was her opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as a way to just sit while the 1950s.
So for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma who <unk> that identity of identity and <unk> capital capital.
For identity, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be later.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and no one knows the future of work, but I know about it: capital capital generating identity.
So now it's the moment for that work on the other side of the country, from that <unk> of that company that they want to try to go.
I'm not <unk> exploration exploration, I'm <unk> the exploration that I shouldn't count, by the way, it's not exploration,
It's <unk>
I said to Emma who <unk> jobs and I told them to count.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> that come together with friends with minds with similar minds just about how you know who you know about, how you talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person with whom is almost always coming out of its closest circle.
The new things come from what they call weak bonds of friends from their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have a job.
But the other half won't, and the weak bonds are the shape of <unk> to this group.
Half of the <unk> jobs would never be <unk> then, knowing the boss of your neighbor is the way to get a job of a job.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is going on.
For the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know his friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but like <unk> Emma soon <unk> his family when he has a mate and it plays his own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think the 30 is better at the time to sit in mind that 20 or even the 25 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But choosing the person that you live right now, or you get away now when everyone on Facebook are starting to walk towards <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before they <unk> and that means being so intentional in love as you are at work.
<unk> your family should be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing it will work or kill time with whoever you nominate you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate of a <unk> cousin who worked in a art museum in another state.
This weak bond helped him get a job there.
That offer of work gave a reason to leave the boyfriend that I alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, loves her new family, and I sent me a letter to send a letter that said, "Now the spaces of synaptic contacts are not <unk> enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are like aircraft coming out of the Los Angeles, who come out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight <unk> in its trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at the age of 21 or the 25 and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good break, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few or even the next generations.
Here's my idea worth spreading to all the <unk> that you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to Alex.
That's what I now have the privilege of telling <unk> as Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get your identity, you get your identity, you get your identity, you know, use your <unk> you choose your family.
They don't stop <unk> so they didn't know what they didn't know.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very tough job at management management for a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach you mathematics to graduate students in the public schools in New York.
And as any professor, <unk> tests and tests.
I gave them tasks.
When the job went by, we would kill grades.
What struck me attention was that GDP was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had better performance didn't have <unk> <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that made me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, safe, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during time.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure a better way.
It's the <unk> but what if you're successful in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn in a quick and soft way.
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all sorts of <unk> <unk> and in every study my question was, who's successful here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> Academy -- West <unk>
We tried to predict what we were trying to predict about military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> National <unk> and we tried to predict what children were going to be as far as possible in the competition.
We studied <unk> teachers working on really difficult neighborhoods, and what teachers are still teaching for the end of the year and <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the outcomes of learning from their <unk>
We partnered with private companies, asking ourselves, which of these <unk> are going to keep their job <unk>
What's going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts -- it emerged a feature as a critical matter of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't good and physical health, and it wasn't <unk>
It was purpose.
<unk> is passion and <unk> to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to its future, day after day, not just a week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a career at all.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in the public schools of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students who did my determination of determination and then waited for over a year to see those who are <unk>
It turns out that the children with more determination had significantly greater chance of graduation, even when the <unk> in every trait that I could measure, the things like family income, the results of <unk> testing -- even the safety of the test they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point, or in the National <unk> National <unk> which matters purpose.
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know how much science is about development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do you be <unk>
What should I do to teach kids a strong ethic of work?
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is: I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give them purpose.
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the determination is commonly related to or even related to the measurements.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination of children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and is the belief that the ability to learn is not <unk> that can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop purpose.
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure whether they have been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to help them start all over again with the <unk>
In other words, we need to be determined about making our kids more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories -- is my mother <unk> beauty, the shape and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that moment, I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated sophisticated language.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learning Chinese might be useful.
Since I was five, I started learning how to draw every single character of every character in every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese <unk> <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand the basic <unk>
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read signals from <unk> menus to understand the basic idea of pages or newspapers.
Today I will start with eight to show you how the method.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as it can be possible until it's <unk>
You get a mouth.
This is a person that's going to give a ride.
<unk>
If the fire shape is a person with arms on both sides, as if I were shouting at <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> in the form of <unk> but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The door of the door looks like a couple of doors on the old West <unk>
I call these eight characters.
They're building blocks so that they create a lot more characters.
One person.
If anyone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are company, three are a crowd.
If a sense of your arms, this person is saying <unk> so big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> such as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree, two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> of remember, because a <unk> tree.
Remember the <unk>
Two <unk> are very hot.
Three statistic together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon light together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door. Get a chart inside the door, is the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> played with someone at home?
This person is coming out of a gate, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, they're <unk>
So we've already spent 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical <unk> will allow them to build 32.
The next group of eight characters to build other 32.
So with every small juice, they'll be able to learn a couple of <unk> which is the same thing you learn a Chinese <unk>
So after knowing the characters, we start to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the Earth of the sun <unk>
This is a sun put back in the beginning, because Japan is to the east of China.
So a sun next started, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains stacked over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies in the mountains.
Today, the <unk> has become a date.
A mouth that tells you where it comes out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be my dad is the films that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the <unk> magician together.
The film <unk> its imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and to take a magic wand
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's remarkable.
We now live and we raise our children in a kind of complex industrial complex <unk>
However, the Oz magician was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took rise to 40 years later with, interestingly, another film whose <unk> a metal boy and a <unk> <unk> <unk> a girl dressed as a <unk> of the enemy.
You know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two films, there are a couple of big differences between the Google magician and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the <unk> <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like the <unk>
But I think if the Oz magician was doing today, the magician would say, <unk> you are the salvation of Oz as the self-fulfilling <unk>
You use magic shoes to defeat the armies generated by the computer <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the Google magician is that the most educated characters and even <unk> are women.
I started noticing this when I was watching "Star <unk> a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son too.
Only three years old.
It wasn't invited to <unk> because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance had been <unk>  And so, she was slid in the room and was impressed like an foot mom with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what he was going on, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be about value, <unk> and <unk>
So I did feel that Luke gets one military to remove the government?
<unk> this with <unk> <unk>
How does Dorothy the film?
We do good <unk> with everybody and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up to grow up, and not a world of men who <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much force <unk> <unk> in movies for our children, and so little on the path of <unk> <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence movies at the girls, and they should be <unk> It's really good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know for experience that Princess <unk> doesn't give you the right framework that had served me to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the moment of the first kiss. I really expect that the credits started to appear because it's the end of the film, right?
My quest is over, I have any <unk>
Why stand there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on <unk> the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a <unk> and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are many exceptions, and to defend Disney Disney princess to any of you.
But they send a message to children, even though they, boys, they're not really their target audience.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to defend themselves against <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend themselves from <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, so real and <unk> like <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being <unk>
Of course, the most successful topic of all the time continues to appear on classic after classic each of them on a child of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who <unk> a child.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out of it.
I recommend all of you, it's available in stores.
Do you remember what the criticism said when he came out of it.
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies passes the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not rooted in its roots and it already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book and in the <unk> '80s, he recorded a conversation that I had had with a friend of mine on the assessment of movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must be <unk> In the film, there is more than a female character that has lines?
So you have to pursue <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the film?
Their conversations are about something else -- from the guy who are so much like the boy who looks so much like that?  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you.
Two women that exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet I really rarely see it in the cinema we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality film, <unk>
Right? <unk> <unk> success -- a consensus idea of what a Hollywood Hollywood film is called quality.
<unk> doesn't happen the test of <unk>
And I don't think I <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen a lot of the movie -- a lot of the movie happens in a embassy where men and women are hiding during the <unk> crisis.
We have many scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great moment for one of the <unk> to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So I <unk> in the numbers.
In 2011, from the 100 <unk> movies, how many of them believe they have actors <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage as the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, so it's okay.
But there's a bigger number than this one who's going to <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, "This is what he said.
In the United States, one out of five women says it's been sexually sexually in their life.
I don't think it's the guilt of mass entertainment.
I don't think movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't think music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is that there's a lot of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do they not achieve <unk>
They're <unk> the story that the role of a male hero is defeat <unk> and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same, we find this world and this <unk> statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools like <unk> <unk> and we hope that that will happen, but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their children to keep their children in order to keep their children in order to keep your children in order to keep your children in order to keep your children in order
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily to the parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of manhood is radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter what was her favorite Star character, Do you know what I <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do these two?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant <unk>
I think they are experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that they know more than anyone, and they love sharing their knowledge with other people to help us achieve their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories that tell my <unk> <unk> and struggle and more stories where you see their job is to join a team -- maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and to be better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As I was a little girl, I lived in Maine and one of the things I liked was to look for <unk> sea on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that I would be lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're coated with sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was fascinated with <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in love for the past and the archeology.
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized about my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up at one of almost 1.3 miles of length next to the <unk>
And my <unk> had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite imagery.
To try and make a map of the past, I knew I had to do it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see using the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern Delta of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, to simple sight, seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and we process it using fake, suddenly the place looks like a brilliant pink <unk>
What you're looking at is the actual chemical changes of the landscape caused by building materials and activities of ancient <unk>
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find an old <unk> city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the old Egypt for over 400 years in a time period called the Middle <unk> about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Ottoman Empire there was this great renaissance of ancient art, architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that the <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge continuous <unk>
This area is massive, it's about <unk> per mile per mile.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved to this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
And to try to find them at random that would be the equivalent of the equivalent of a needle in a <unk> with <unk> eyes, and using baseball.
So we use NASA <unk> data to make a map of place, with very subtle changes.
So we could see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly elevated area that looks inside the circle here, that we think could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with scientific scientists doing <unk> jobs -- you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of sample in ice, but instead of the layer of climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five meters down, underneath a thick layer of <unk> we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a <unk> occupation of several hundred years that date back from the Empire exact same period we think is <unk>
We also found works of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which shows that there was a <unk> shop there.
This might seem not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones -- they used in the jewelry of the Empire and these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense occupation of <unk> which comes from the Middle <unk> in this place.
We also have evidence of a elite <unk> shop that shows that what's been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but let's go to the place in the near future to <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians on the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Empire the Middle East, probably four years ago.
To share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on land.
So it turns out, TED wasn't founded in 1984 <unk>
Do ideas actually start in 1984 B.C. in a missing city not for a long time and found from the top.
It certainly puts the search for wine <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of <unk>
I want you to pay attention to the color of the gate, the material that he's made.
Now <unk> a group of obese <unk>
They are competing in a bicycle <unk> and they go back to their door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
They <unk> against the door of their house.
There are bikes flying around, wheels that go on their side, lightning on the wheels that end up in <unk> places, <unk> the threshold of the gate, <unk>
<unk> in the lobby, or whatever the other side of the door, and watch the quality of the light. The light's shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with your hand.
<unk> on a brown horse here.
It's a horse that is speech.
You can feel your blue <unk> <unk> in your nose.
You can smell the <unk> and you spend that you're about to get into the mouth.
He <unk> around and trained her living room.
In the room, and making most of their imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothes, dancing on his home center, singing <unk> <unk> One More <unk> One More <unk>
Now you go to the kitchen.
The soil has been coated with a yellow brick path and from the oven. You come to you <unk> the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len in "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of hands, <unk>
Okay. You open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular contest that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the U.S. <unk> <unk>
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, I suppose, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few ladies and a few different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of <unk> numbers just once.
<unk> the names of dozens and dozens of strangers.
They had entire poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people must be nature of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and he has one of the best <unk>
I asked him, "Do you <unk> when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I am not a wise.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everybody involved in this competition they say they have normal memory.
We said, "We have trained to perform these miraculous acts of memory using old <unk> invented 2,500 years ago, in Greece, the same techniques that they used to memorize their <unk> and that the medieval scholars were used to memorize <unk>
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I have heard of this <unk>
We were standing outside the hall of competition, and Ed, who is wonderful and brilliant English, although a little <unk> said to me, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You meet Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of cards in national television TV.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start with something right?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up most of the year next year, not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He is <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a problem of <unk> it's awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that lets you see what our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the paper of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We spent an afternoon together in the public library in the Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And the way back, I read a number of treaties on memory about 2,000 years ago in Latin, in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having <unk> and disciplined memory was not as rare as it can look like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they also have changed.
We have changed it, and I would say that we have changed our cognitive <unk>
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes it seems to have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you are still passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory -- is this such competition of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there's <unk> like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College College invited a memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know, whether you have brains in some sense, structural brains or different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They are more intelligent than the <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test, and the answer was not really.
There was yet a really interesting and significant difference between the brains of the memory champions and the control subjects with the <unk>
When they put them in an MRI MRI MRI machine. It <unk> your brains as they <unk> numbers, faces and forms of <unk> they found that in the memory champions <unk> <unk> parts of the brain, different to each other.
It actually <unk> or seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves space and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament in <unk> <unk> is driving as a race race in which every year comes to someone with a new way of remembering more things, and then the rest of the competitors must get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times <unk>
In his desk, in front of him, there are 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> that he is about to try to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and he just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
<unk> Yes.
And as there is a lot of ways of remembering things in these <unk> -- absolutely all of the techniques used at the end is reduced to one concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It's illustrates with a elegant paradox as the <unk> paradox, he says this: I say two people who remember the same word. I say to you, <unk> that there's a man named <unk>
That's her last name.
And then I ask you, you know, there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I asked them, I wonder that word I told you about a <unk>
Did you know what <unk>
The person who told her her name is Baker and it's unlikely to remember the same word that the person who told her work is <unk>
The same word, different capacity of <unk> that is weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean nothing for you, it has no relationship to you.
With all the other memories they dance on their head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have <unk> in their hands.
<unk> well when they come home to work.
You probably <unk> some <unk>
And when we <unk> that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> at some time back.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this back two years ago in the Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> who did a <unk>
They had hired him as a entertainment, because before, if I wanted to give a very good party, you wouldn't have been brought to a <unk> <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up, <unk> his memory poem and <unk> and so soon it was, the <unk> <unk>
<unk> everyone.
But not only killed them all, but it shattered the bodies of <unk>
No one could say who was there, no one could remember where they were sitting.
So you couldn't afford the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
He stopped standing out of the rubble, in the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with his eyes in his mind, I could see where I had been sitting in every single <unk>
He took the family of the <unk> hand where their loved ones were in the rubble.
What we <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we're not good at remembering names or phone numbers or instructions word for the word of our colleagues, we have a beautiful visual memory and spatial space.
If you <unk> me to give you the first 10 words of the story I just told you about <unk> it's very likely to be very difficult to do it.
But I would bet that if you ask them to say who was sitting on the horse <unk> in his lobby, they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of their mind and <unk> images with the things that you want to remember. The more crazy -- we know, <unk> <unk> and <unk> is the image, more <unk> to be.
This is a advice that comes from more than 2,000 years ago, to the first <unk> <unk> in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to make it memory in the same way he would have made it <unk> if they were invited to <unk> years ago.
What you might do is imagine that they're on the door of your house.
And to come up with some sort of image of absolutely ridiculous, crazy and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing you want to mention is that <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> on Mister <unk>
And that would remind you that you want to introduce his friend Ed <unk>
And then you see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote you want to count.
And then it entered the kitchen, and the fourth issue that would talk to would be that strange journey that was done for a year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
This is how <unk> <unk> <unk> their <unk> not word for the word, that it's being confused but typical for typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a remnant of when people thought about <unk> and the rhetoric with this sort of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> first <unk> would be like the first place in its <unk>
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got out of full of it.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing a lot about this <unk> <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
But seriously, it's like looking at a lot of people sitting by doing exams. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets <unk> on the front.
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things going on in the minds of these people, but I don't have access to them.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes, all the <unk> before sit on the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old <unk> school <unk> in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was pretty entertaining.
I would never have expected to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What it's really about doing is to improve more and more the ability to create and imagine these <unk> images -- <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I'm pretty excited about this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and some security ray covered with tape.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that he had covered a year before. He had the idea that you could go in, in a sort of <unk> experiment.
I thought this might be good <unk> for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice to be able to memorize <unk> and phone numbers and <unk> but actually this is not the point.
These are just <unk> <unk>
Because they're based on quite basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> or they <unk> <unk> to benefit from <unk> to benefit from how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a <unk> gift but not the case.
The great memories are <unk>
At the most basic, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we really focus on deeply.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> a kind of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of you are not <unk> out there.
But the reality is that there is no shortcuts.
That's how things are <unk>
And if there's one thing I want to leave you with today is what I <unk> the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, it left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is our <unk> <unk> in <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walk around us, are going to be so <unk> that we don't even care about processing <unk>
I learned firsthand that there are amazing memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you have to be the kind of person remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk today about the last 30 years of history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex topic, so that we just <unk> a <unk> place New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> Jersey, I was six years ago, and I lived there in my parents' home in a village called <unk> and this was my child's bedroom.
In the corner, I was the bathroom I was sharing with my sister.
And between my dorm and the bathroom, there was a balcony that would give the living room.
And then everybody passed the time watching television -- so every time I was going from my room to the bathroom, everyone would see me, and every time I <unk> and I wrapped up on a <unk> I would all be seen.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> insecure and hated it.
<unk> that journey, hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, and division of areas, but of those <unk> emotional connections, that we feel in the places that are <unk>
And no wonder that we feel like that way, because according to Environmental Protection <unk>  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
The architecture is defined in ways that we don't even notice.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you think about you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that they think about it by based on a building built 2,500 years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> using architects to create an emotional connection with the ways that we build our buildings.
It's an emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build museum museums.
And in the 20th century, in the U.S., we used it to build houses.
You see, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building stuff is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a lot of time and it's very complicated.
People who build <unk> and governments are always afraid to innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
That's why we found buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public <unk> Library that was finished in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has a <unk> it has this round thing, the red brick -- that you leave <unk> what you <unk> tries to communicate with this <unk> children, the values of property, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, the other library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So how is it possible in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works by the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects constantly drive new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for life forms today.
We got it up and we got it so much, and we got it away from all the people.
All of the black, we <unk> you think we feel very well, but we're dead in because we don't have any other choice.
We need to go to the other side and get it back to connect with those <unk> symbols in it.
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we start to experiment with <unk> we make it swing the way back to go ahead and over and over again. So we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, it was about the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
Can you guess.
<unk> small, on a <unk> scale.
Really really hard.
So we are approaching the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
We <unk> the <unk> in the other direction.
We take those ways we know and the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added a pair of new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we turned them into <unk> that can be <unk> <unk> made of glass.
The shapes was <unk> won by audacity and <unk>
The <unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
It's crazy.
But it was the '80s, that was great.
We all spent the time in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there, in the suburbs, we could create our own erotic <unk>
These fantasies could be the <unk> or the <unk> or <unk>
Maybe with a <unk> of <unk> of bread.
This is what happens with <unk>
This is what happens with symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we <unk> memories of elsewhere.
I know very well, and you all know this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
Architects feel frustrated and began to swing the <unk> to the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the <unk> symbols now -- we have new design techniques techniques -- and we find ourselves with new <unk> a few ways that <unk> against other forms.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You are totally <unk>
Normally the pendulum <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then something happened.
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical and public and public and public were completely <unk> on a building.
The New York Times <unk> this <unk> <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao went over two and a half thousand percent of them when the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, to Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first <unk> <unk>
But how is it possible that these forms, wild and radical how is it possible that they become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media will spread around them and quickly learned that those shapes meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The same thing did the main mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had culture and culture and tourism.
This <unk> phenomenon happened with other architects a star.
He went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects at the threshold of the new millennium, actually began to happen with all human architecture, digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think about how we consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walked up to the next town to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
Technology <unk> You can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we all are photographers of architecture, and the building is carried beyond its physical <unk>
The architecture is everywhere, that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast.
It doesn't take a long time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings, before I know if I designed four years ago, it was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we found ourselves buildings like this.
<unk> was not a two-year-old <unk> but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much <unk>
That is never going to happen, because we're at the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the <unk> of steel or the elevator and the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to the media, <unk> media, it starts to swing faster and faster, until it's going to be on both extremes that are almost <unk> and <unk> actually the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you are the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> from something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, the building, was already part of the community. And like drawings looked exactly the product over, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community -- that first summer, when people started getting together and shared it in social media, the building stopped being a way of communication, because these are not just images of a building, it's the images that one made of the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and when you charge these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other about what we think of architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those <unk> <unk>
If that building built today, first <unk> to the Internet looking for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of innovation, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell them that there is no unique response to what is a library today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
Architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and drawings -- and you are no longer a <unk> public that doesn't have anything ever seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't stop <unk> for architecture.
That means that the pendulum <unk> from one way to another, from a movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find appropriate solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be only and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of <unk> red brick from what it should be at <unk>
This means that some robots can build our buildings, because we finally will be ready for the ways that will produce.
That means that the buildings will be <unk> to the <unk> of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage garage in Miami Beach, Florida, it can also serve to do sports or to <unk> or even you can marry there at night.
This means that three architects can dream with swimming in the East <unk> of New York, and raising half a million dollars of the surrounding community around that cause, is no longer a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what it matters is what we build.
Architects already know how to make more and more intelligent buildings and more kind.
We've been waiting for everybody to want.
Finally, we're not on the opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk> <unk> and working together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot on play.
The buildings not just reflect our society, but they give way to the most <unk> spaces and the local libraries of the homes where we form our children, and the <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it does it in that great way of the children of a year, <unk> as if their body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is look at the mirror.
She really loves her reflection.
It <unk> and <unk> and it gives himself those big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all of your friends do this and my mom tells me I used to do it, and I think, "When did we stop doing this?
How do we suddenly be comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people looking at it, "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> he's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be liked and fit in.
It's Sunday night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
He's got a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because even though her mom tells you all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, someone says she's ugly.
Out of what her mom tells you and what his friends, or school in school is saying, you don't know who they believe.
So a video of it is making it on YouTube, and ask others you please leave a <unk> "I'm nice, or I'm a <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has received over 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talked about a healthy and normal teenager, which gets these answers in one of the stages of their life in the stages of their life more vulnerable emotionally.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it going to do this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure from being online and available all the time, talking to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> this is never over.
Never before we have been so connected, in a continuous way as young as <unk>
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party in your room every single <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that is <unk>
This environment, and it's always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of likes to have and the kinds of reviews that they do.
There is no divide between life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what is real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what is authentic and what is <unk>
What is the biggest thing in the life of someone who is normal in a daily context.
And where are you looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news reports now.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to do with what young people <unk>
But kids are also not immunity to this.
Like the superheroes stars of the sport, and the singers <unk>
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our children to grow healthy and be <unk> individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and effort and mental effort to their appearance, the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies, and other ways they start to hurt.
Six in 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't look pretty enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They're fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and as they taxpayers society and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the <unk> class.
One out of five are not <unk> at all during the days when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the season season -- if you don't think you see good enough, specifically if you don't think you're <unk> <unk> a lower note on the average of your fellow <unk> who don't care about what the looks.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, United States and China.
And it gets independently of what these young people are <unk>
So in order to be nice of course, we're talking about how you see you, not how you really are.
The little self-esteem of your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenagers with little self-esteem are less physical activity, they eat less fruit and vegetables, participate in more <unk> not healthy than they can take them into a food <unk>
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around them and are at greater risk of depression.
And we think it's all because of what they make more <unk> decisions like the consumption of alcohol and of drugs, <unk> <unk> surgery, sexual <unk> and no protection and damage to <unk>
The search for the perfect body is pushing the health care system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they're overweight again, regardless of whether they have or higher rates of <unk>
And 17 percent of women are not present to a job interview in a day that they don't feel safe with the way they can see.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would be that <unk>
<unk> this potential is in interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, I'm talking about, it doesn't take you too far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key <unk> the first one is that we have to nurture trust in their own body.
We need to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and building their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do that.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was really amazed when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it, I would get the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children are still going to have a positive impact -- but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focused on six key areas, the first is the influence of family influence and friends and relationships.
These six things are starting to be starting for anyone willing to provide an education in body self-esteem than it works.
A education is <unk> but to deal with this problem requires each of us to take charge on the issue and be a better model to follow by women and girls in our own lives.
Let's challenge the status of the current status of how women are seen and talked about our circles.
It's not good to tell the contribution of our politicians in terms of hair or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that determination or the success of a <unk> athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to begin to judge people so they are, not as you can see.
And all of us can start doing that by taking responsibility for the kind of images and feedback that we published in our social networks.
We can <unk> people based on their effort, and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you when was the last time you <unk> a <unk>
In short, we need to work together as communities, as governments and as a companies, to change our culture, so our children grow to valuing their whole person, valuing <unk> diversity, <unk>
We need to put people who are actually making a difference in a <unk>
So let's make a difference in the real world, let's make it be the ones that go on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they are never seeing the <unk> of being who they are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your lives.
Who do you have in mind?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
<unk> her <unk>
Could the woman be simply the woman who is at two car seats -- what would it mean for her if he was released from that <unk> voice in her interior, he was <unk> by not having long legs, <unk> more skinny, a more <unk> feet more <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were <unk> this and we would make birth of the potential that way?
Right now, the obsession with our culture with the images are <unk> us all together.
But let's get our kids true.
It turns out that the way you see is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and so they make us feel.
They <unk> the self-esteem of our schools.
Let's change each one of us, the way we talk about and compared to other people.
And we work together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of the age of a year of the age of a year of their own tomorrow.
So let's do it.
On November of November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
<unk> initially was the naive, but being a prisoner in the other minor <unk> in the company of others, they began to plan attacks from New <unk> in New York, including <unk> <unk> and the U.N.
Luckily, those plans was led by an FBI informant for <unk>
Sadly, the pump from 1993 in the World Trade Center, couldn't be <unk>
Later on, he would be convicted of his participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer <unk> with an American mother, American mother, elementary school School to the two and I did all possible for giving me an happy childhood, giving me a happy childhood school.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My dad taught me a way of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims come to meet.
I saw that when people take time to <unk> it doesn't require a lot to get the same things in life.
However, in all of religion, in all human groups, there's always a tiny fraction of people who are being used so <unk> to their convictions that we have to use all the possible media that they all lived like them.
A few months before the arrest he sat with me and explained that in the last few weekends he and some friends, had been going to try to shoot him in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> who, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I was <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder, and explained to me how to point to the goal to about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet he shot <unk> I gave the little orange light on the goal and to surprise all of all, especially mine, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle turned to the other and Arab <unk> <unk> <unk>
As a parent, just child.
All of all, the comment produced a lot of laughter. But just a few years later, I understood what it was so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
These people later would be convicted of putting a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the underground parking lot of the World Trade Center, causing an explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved to 20 times. That instability during my childhood couldn't let me make a lot of friendships.
Every time I started feeling comfortable about someone was already a time to pack and get to another city.
As it was always me the new face of the class often was <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid the white -- but it's going to be the new of the kind of silent and <unk> it was enough <unk>
So most of the time I was reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons we did not developed social skills, to put it very <unk> for <unk> I was not prepared for the real world.
I <unk> <unk> to judge people, based on <unk> indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that actually tested my way of thinking about it was during the presidential presidential elections.
In a <unk> program that was involved in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the youth of juvenile violence -- like I had been a <unk> victim almost all of my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I found that one of the kids who had made <unk> <unk> was <unk>
I took a few days out of the light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and I really felt very proud to have been able to beat the barrier that my whole life was made to believe that he was <unk>
Another crucial moment when I got a summer work when I got a summer work in Bush <unk> an amusement park.
I found myself with people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was critical to the development of my character.
All life was taught to me that the <unk> was a sin and, by extension, all gay men were bad <unk>
By chance, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the <unk> and less critics I'd seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, I developed an empathy sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people in the way as I wish we wish to be treated.
And so I could contrast the stereotypes that I had taught as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what that is to be homosexual but I know what is being judged by something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
All night, Jon Stewart made me being honest about my <unk> and helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, you have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my <unk> figure at a time when I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> wasn't in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was doing my way of thinking, and she told me something to conserve in my heart forever while she's alive.
She looked at me with my eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough <unk> and said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all of that hate inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break my father's relationship and start a new life.
So why did I go out and put into a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope you someone, one day, which is what I'm trying to take to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there's a better way, that although I gave me this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against the prejudice.
I do it by the victims of the terrorism and their loved ones, the terrible pain and the loss that terrorism has made them in their lives.
By the victims of terrorism and speaking against those meaningless acts, as rejection to the actions of my father.
With this <unk> I put up here as a proof that violence is not an inherent to any religion or race, that children don't have to follow the trails of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you.  Thank you.
At this point, there's a film that projects in their minds.
It's an incredible movie movie.
It's in 3D, it has <unk> sound of what you hear and you see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your movie has <unk> tastes and texture.
You feel your body, your pain, your hunger or your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like moments of your childhood that is settling into your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed on your stream of conscious thinking.
The <unk> heart is you who experiences all directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an actual internal film, you, you and you.
There is nothing we would get more directly.
At least, I know I have an <unk>
I don't have certain that you are aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason for a living.
If we weren't conscious of our lives or meaning or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these <unk> <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we are trying to produce the results without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this point, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible, a science of consciousness.
The science, by nature, is objective for nature.
<unk> by nature, is <unk>
So there's never a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, that vision is <unk>
The psychology is studying <unk> behavior. The neuroscience is studying the <unk> brain, but never one mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED began, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> as Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a flowering of the science work of consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental constraints to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this kind of wonderful work that I announced Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of <unk>
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain to you by saying that this kind of work of neuroscience answers some questions that we want to explain to consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain do and with what they <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
And without <unk>
Actually, there is no easy problems with consciousness.
So not tackles the real mystery of this <unk> why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is a movie internal <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to turn into another emergent phenomenon like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors, how do you operate the <unk> how they work <unk> how they <unk> are adapting and <unk> the living organisms are all questions about the work work.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon -- how we speak, how we speak, how we speak, how we play <unk> are all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why all behavior is accompanied by an out-of-body experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't have a lot to say.
I am a <unk> <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that works. For a long time, I was beating the head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms that would work.
But at the end I got to the conclusion that it didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we would focus on this point.
We have a beautiful explanation, and we have a lot of wonderful explanations -- the physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this schema.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're aware of.
For the other we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific worldview, in the world.
I think that consciousness, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate our worldview, but we don't even know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that initially <unk> <unk> before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, Dennett, who's here has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no such difficult problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the subjective subjective movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you need to do, is to explain the functions of the brain -- the behaviors of the brain, and this is studies that all you need explanation.
Well, more power to him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a purely <unk> theory based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is quite close to simply denying that the observation of consciousness is <unk>
But I go into a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental.
physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as a core brick space, the space and mass.
<unk> laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of nothing else.
On the contrary, they considered the fundamental the way the world is built.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> found that you cannot explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts <unk> space, mass rules, so it applied the basic laws of <unk> and it applied the power charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas <unk> space, time, mass, <unk> then for the question of logic, you have <unk>
The most natural thing would be <unk> the same as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens the path for <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that govern consciousness with other fundamental concepts of space -- the space, the mass processes, processes.
physicists sometimes say we want the fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is like this.
We want to find very simple laws that we could put it into a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
And this vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for all, <unk> in mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, the dogs, the <unk> the mice, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea isn't that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of distress when I think about my <unk> always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that maybe photons can have some kind of raw feeling -- <unk> some primitive precursor from consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would anyone think about something so <unk>
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is fundamental to it.
If it's <unk> like space, time and mass is natural to assume that it can also be universal, like the others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's much less for people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason, comes from the idea that perhaps the most powerful and powerful way to find fundamental laws that <unk> thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Because there's always processing information, there is consciousness.
<unk> complex <unk> like in a human being, complex consciousness of it.
<unk> of simple data, simple consciousness of information.
One very exciting thing is that in recent years a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed it <unk> with mathematical methods.
It has a measure of integration integration of information, which is called <unk> which measures the level of information integrated into a system.
And it's supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of processing information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse -- there is a level of integration integration of information, just quite significant -- a pretty important <unk>
But when it comes to the <unk> microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The <unk> level of information is <unk> but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of <unk>
It actually raises a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Furthermore, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into the physical world.
physicists and philosophers often have observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It <unk> the structure of reality using lots of equations, but we don't talk about the reality underlying the below.
As Stephen Hawking, like, "Where are the fire <unk>
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics can be left as they are, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically described the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is no longer outside of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision, has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can be social and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that I had consciousness, then I must be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll get a lot hungry.
I think we think about it, this tends to transform your vision, while what matters in ethical terms, and <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the view of information <unk> she has a complicated information processing -- so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, you have a very serious ethical problems about the ethics of the development of intelligent computers and the ethic of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for collective consciousness -- the planet.
Canada has its own <unk>
Or a more local level, an integrated group -- like the audience in a TED Talk, we now have a true collective consciousness, a film that is internal film for this full group of TED, different from every single <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question you have to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually more safe than the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, than the second one, that it's universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, a lot of challenges, like, how do those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex awareness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path towards a theory of serious consciousness.
If not, well, it's probably the most difficult problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve this overnight.
But I think we're going to finally get to discover.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile, and it had a very normal profile.
I went to school, I <unk> with my friends, my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because he wanted to be <unk> for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice -- but there's an unhappy problem.
She didn't actually get anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a <unk> on the <unk> of my mother, and I spent a long time looking at the series of <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing to be considered as a achievement if we take the disability outside of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching at a high school in a <unk> high school for about 20 minutes in the class 11 of studies -- a guy raised his hand, and he said, "Hey, when to give you your <unk>
I said, "What?"
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people in chairs of wheels, they talk about <unk> things at school?"
<unk> in the <unk> room.
And then when I realized, this child had had experiences with people with disability people as an inspiration.
And we don't. And it's not the fault of the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people. We're there to inspire it.
And in fact, I am on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair, and you're probably waiting for you to ask them, right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid I'm <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we were lied to about disability.
Yes, we have sold the lie that disability is <unk> A capital <unk>
It's something wrong and living with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not something wrong and you can't make you remarkable.
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or is this <unk> <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a huge amount of them.
You may have seen one, from the girl with no hands by drawing with a pencil held by her mouth.
You may have seen a kid running with carbon fiber legs.
And there are a lot of these images, which are what we call porn <unk>
And I use the <unk> porn term because they would give a group of people to the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, <unk> the people in the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad that my life, could be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that I've been talking about strange <unk> to express you think I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was going to happen before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I stood up in the morning and remember my own name --  And this is <unk>
These images, these images are <unk> to people with a disability for people without disability.
They're there so you can see them and think that things aren't so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a difficult thing.
So let's get some things.
But the things that we <unk> are not the things that you can think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I gave myself the so-called social model of the <unk> that tells us that we're more <unk> because of the society that we live than due to our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
It makes the things I need you to do, and I've learned how much of your ability to do that as well as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They are simply using their bodies by taking the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do that, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says like a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because you've sold this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, he doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> inspiration and you think, "Oh my God, you're not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And I actually know I'm here.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't know that I am more lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that fall over.   <unk> the ingenious trick of how to charge your mobile phone battery in the battery of the chair.
Great.
We learn from force and resilience of others, not our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really think that this lie that you have sold us about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that <unk> "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles at a distance of stairs has not been done to become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> to a television screen won't show the <unk> for people <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to convert all those books to <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his dorm room watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> don't be considered nothing to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people with disability that we are <unk> out of the bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of the people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a boy of the 11 degree in Melbourne is not a little amazed that her new teacher is a <unk>
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but to question what you think to know about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to see augmented reality and professional football with <unk>
And what's the average speed of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, today I'm just answering one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think of <unk> think about "Minority <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for that, and people need to know it, because reality reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is to be a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you fill with your imagination.
We can use the Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what is running through the game game <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that a <unk> man feels like a <unk> man <unk> us trying to marry all of his self.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
I would have a few videos to show you what Google <unk> is under the helmet, and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of <unk> practices because the idea of the <unk> technology is a submarine going up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
So a moment. Let's give you a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is to be <unk> in the football field, from the perspective of the <unk>
You might have realized that we lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Blue <unk> Blue <unk>
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more to the feeling in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, will be their favorite players and asked me on YouTube and <unk> <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
<unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get into <unk> how we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which you probably know about.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the virtual reality device ever created, and it's not <unk> cheap.
And I'm going to show you why I fear with this video.
Man: Oh, <unk>
No, no, no! You don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh my God! Ah!
CK: That's the experience of a man on a rollercoaster that was <unk> by his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you <unk> a video of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with your arm before running and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of a fan of <unk>
When I could be <unk> running through the <unk> throwing the ball into the bottom of the network?  Or you would take a stick in <unk>
What is your experience when you walk from a mountain to more than 100 <unk> like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe they <unk> the <unk> for adults.
But this isn't really <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How can we get the reality of <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality <unk> when <unk> <unk> and owners see the information of what people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So here's a quick refresher on technology in <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore had a <unk> to his field <unk> to play it more quickly.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put <unk> in the <unk> <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more <unk> because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that they're a player coming back to their group, and you see their next move that you can be shown in front of you, in a plastic <unk> that wear <unk> you don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
or they memorize the strategy.
They're just coming out of the field and <unk>
And the coaches want to do it, because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, and they hate losing <unk>
If you lose parties like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your <unk>
How would you go here?
Well, a very simple choice would be having a camera on every corner of the stadium -- having a view from the high of the people who are down.
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and the <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information is being sent to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad people are <unk>
This <unk> the good equipment.
So your team of computer will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis to stop being just to do.
They also would be <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would the <unk>
Imagine the field <unk>
You <unk> the ball and <unk>
I got an open receiver of a sudden, a <unk> on the left side of your bombsight -- you would tell you that an defense behind you is going to <unk> Usually not <unk> but the <unk> system will be <unk>
<unk> the protection.
Another <unk> you know, there's an open <unk>
<unk> the <unk> but you <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where we can see, however, the receptor sees in its bombsight an area of grass that lights up and can modify the race.
It was <unk> It takes the <unk> running and <unk>
The public <unk> and fans have been following this happen from every angle.
This is something that creates a massive emotion on the game.
I'm going to do a lot of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it just as bread and <unk> as our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone who is literally going to be in the place of another person.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology for a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how <unk> are their actions from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay rights in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives being <unk>
How much is it for a <unk> <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think about more in space and science rather than <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the <unk> reality is close.
The questions we make, the decisions we do and the challenges that we face and the challenges that we face, <unk> as always, from us.
Thank you.
I recently <unk> after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years in the country <unk> the southern end of Lofa County, which includes the bridge <unk> <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure known by its beautiful views of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its inspiring <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the world's most used places.
The <unk> bridge was opened up in <unk>
Joseph <unk> a police chief leader of building the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is no practical or <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to his death from that bridge.
Some of you believe that traveling between the two towers will take you to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that each of it frees you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used for <unk> suicide.
After a free fall of four to five seconds, the body hits the water <unk> about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks bone, some of which we have a vital organs.
Most of them die in impact.
The ones that not, they normally fall into the <unk> water, and then they <unk>
I don't think the ones that <unk> this suicide method will realize the death of the death that they <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel in the bridge.
So here is where most people are to do before they take their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the most dark time, it's very difficult to bring it back.
I took this photo last year while this young man spoke with a officer looking at her life.
I want to tell you the joy that we had success that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who killed the suicide, but to the officers as well.
We've come a long way from then.
Today, official scientists and psychologists train new official <unk>
This is Jason <unk>
I met him about 22 <unk> last year when you get a call from a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking about a <unk> bridge.
Jason had only 32 years old, and it had flown up to here from New Jersey.
In fact, it had flown up to two times before from New Jersey to try to stay from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked us if we knew the story of the <unk> box.
<unk> the mythology of <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
And she came out of <unk> <unk> and all sorts of <unk> against man.
The only thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a few <unk> leaned on on the right, and he did.
This guy kind kind kind kind and smart from New Jersey had just taken out of life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, my family rabbi called me to see what she was.
The parents of Jason had had her order.
<unk> loss of suicide affects a lot of people.
Let me ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or somebody would be <unk>
What do you say?
<unk> what do you say?
In my experience, you don't just have to talk, but you have to hear.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or tell the person you know how to feel like, because you probably don't want it.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think somebody is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have thought about finishing your life, you've had these <unk>
It <unk> the person in front of saving life and to be the tipping point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, to believe that things are terrible and never go to <unk> <unk> believe that there is nothing you can do to the <unk> social isolation, and a lost of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read your letter.
She lost her son on the 19th of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and he was with his permit and blessing to read it.
"Hello, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience being there.
I'm thinking I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, and so on.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party.
He never got there.
He called the police of <unk> and <unk> it as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two official came home and reported that the car was down in the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been wrong with no suffer a real mental disease.
It shouldn't be so easy to end up with it.
My sentences are with you for your fight.
<unk> the <unk> Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge, and go to the path that her son took that day, and also the courage to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean by hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I wrote a radio call for a possible subject of a <unk> <unk> on the sidewalk <unk>
I <unk> my motorcycle motorcycle and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> on the sidewalk.
When she saw me, crossed the <unk> and stopped at that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the hour and the next one, I heard like Kevin talked about her depression and despair.
Kevin decided for his mind that day to return on that lane and give life another chance.
When Kevin did, I <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked her, "What was he that he made you <unk> and you gave the hope to hope and life again.
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I <unk>
I stopped talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from my Kevin, mother, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the 11th of 11th and you're one of the reasons that Kevin is following us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness, which has been properly <unk>
<unk> to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious of all those traits -- but thanks to God, now we know.
Kevin is in order, as he said.
We give God for you.
<unk> in debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end of her write, <unk> When I visited General San Francisco Hospital that night, you <unk> like the patient.
<unk> I had to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and a member of society.
It speaks openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that their history inspire others.
suicide is not just something I've been found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was <unk> with poison.
That act, despite the end of his own pain of my own pain, the opportunity to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who think about the suicide, they wouldn't think of hurt another person.
They just want their own chest pain.
Usually this is only done from three things: you sleep or alcohol or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge.
Of those incidents I've been directly involved -- I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who told him about an hour.
During that time, my hand at three times.
In the final hand, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we get to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few who have jumped from the bridge, and lived and that can talk about it, that one one or <unk> most of those people have said that the second left of the side has said that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't only connect with San Francisco, but also to people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that every single one of us should be able to work for doing.
<unk> can prevent.
There's help. There is hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you're not, but in your inner you know what you are, and a question asks you, how do you become in that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone, I'm not alone.
When I became a model I felt I had finally achieved the dream that I had had since a child.
My external exterior finally <unk> with my inner truth, with my inner truth.
For complicated reasons, the ones I'm going to go back later, when I look at this picture, I think, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But the past October, I discovered that I am just starting.
We all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the <unk> value to get rid of the constraints of the skin or the beliefs of those around us.
These are people who are always challenging the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, a lot of my friends, my <unk> even, my story.
I think this <unk> is called <unk>
This is mine.
I felt like <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this shirt on my head.
And my mom asked me, "Why are you always wearing that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, my hair is a <unk>
I knew how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but we now know that, really, it's more complex and mystery of <unk>
Because of my success, I never told myself to share my story, not because I thought it will be a bad thing, but because of how the world comes to those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I thank you to be a woman.
I have mom, Dad and a family who take me as a family.
Many aren't so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist <unk> of compassion.
There's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And when I was eight, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these mysteries.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared in front of me, and I remember that moment as if something like me, this is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I still wore a man, I met this woman named <unk>
It's the head of a <unk> beauty competition.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you ever been in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she <unk> she was responsible for the <unk> and <unk> and that night, he won in his <unk> I won in <unk> and he was a third <unk> between over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not many people can say that their first job was the queen of beauty of <unk> women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when they met remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom.
I <unk>
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know if you <unk> the United States you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I would put two <unk> to my name.
She accompanied me when I was <unk> in Thailand to age 19.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities to do the most educated and safe surgeries to do the table.
At that time in the U.S., you need to get the surgery before the name and the gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name <unk> and the female <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity identity means power or able to get a <unk> but for me it was a license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears were <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and it will be model.
Many aren't so fortunate.
I think of this woman from <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who <unk> lived his truth, but that <unk> put in end his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All the 20 of November we make a global <unk> by <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage because of a long story of people who are <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't continue to live my truth, and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live your truth without shame, and fear.
I'm here, <unk> so you have no longer ever <unk> than 20 of <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept who I am.
Do you do it?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Yeah. <unk> first, thank you with all my <unk>
And my parents especially, my parents especially, my family, which is very strong.
I remember all of the times I've been to young women who have <unk> and some times, when they called me and told me that their parents couldn't embrace it, I would take my mom and said, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked, other no. It's just gender identity, that's what is at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all assigned a gender at birth, and what I am trying to do is put on the table the subject that sometimes that <unk> wouldn't block, and there should be a space that would allow people to do, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
<unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
It should have understanding.
There should be room for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope you all be my allies.
KS: Thank you. <unk> <unk> Thank you.
In many other societies, and tribal societies, parents are usually known for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who is known for her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending his rights in 2007. And when he was <unk> his efforts in 2011, by the <unk> the National Health <unk> became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at human history, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when you're born a girl, her birth is not <unk>
It's not welcome not for your father, not by your mother.
The neighborhood comes home -- gives her to the mother and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother <unk> a lot for having a child.
When you give birth to the first child, the first child, he gets sad.
When he gives birth to the second daughter, he <unk> and with the hope of a child, when he <unk> her third daughter, feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only Mother <unk> <unk> daughter <unk> when she happens, she suffers as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, you stay home and the elementary school to her brothers.
Up to the age of 12 years, somehow, it has a good life.
You can <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and you can move on the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it is 13 years old, you have to prohibit himself from your home without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the name of her father and her brothers and her brothers and her family, and if they did <unk> the code of that honor, you could even kill it.
And it's interesting that this <unk> of honor, not only affect the life of a <unk> also affects the life of the male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and her happiness of her sisters in the name of honor.
And there's a standard of <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the <unk>
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be <unk> and it accepts the decisions of her father and her mother and decisions of the elderly and the decisions of the elderly even if you don't will.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if you put it with an old man -- he has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> too young, it has to embrace it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens in the end?
In the words of a <unk> <unk> <unk> and then gives birth to more and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson from <unk> to her daughter and the same lesson of honor to his children.
And this vicious circle continues and continues.
I <unk> brothers and sisters, when I was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like how newborns, to be honest, but when I was there, and I looked at her eyes, believe me, I felt extremely <unk>
And a lot before I came up and thought about his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> of <unk> and he called my daughter like this.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I <unk> a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half years old,
So you might wonder, why should I mention a little girl in a school?"
Yeah, I should <unk>
They can give it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in societies in tribal societies, is a great event for life life.
<unk> in a school means recognition of her identity and his name.
One <unk> means that it has entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks before, when I <unk> the form of tourist <unk> and I was in the relative to the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters written in a document.
That was the reason for the value to my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and her daughters, thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and my daughter.
I would sit with me when my friends came to see me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this was not just for her, just to <unk>
I've <unk> all these good values in my school to girls and girls alike.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught my students, to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, sisters, sisters, women's rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights and in particular, for women's rights.
His name was <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's participation in all of the political, economic and social <unk>
Hundreds of schools were gone.
girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> girls <unk> and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have those people who kill and <unk> when you're talking about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10, <unk> got up and got up by the right to education.
He wrote a day for the BBC, of the BBC, he was offered for New York Times, and he talked about every platform he could.
And her voice was the most powerful.
It's <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban could not tolerate their campaign and the ninth of October 2012, was shot shot in the head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a great black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, he <unk> my ear to my wife -- <unk> <unk> for what happened to my daughter, to your daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said, "Please do you <unk>
We have the right cause.
<unk> your life for the cause of truth, because of the cause of peace, and because of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
Both of them were on the right path and God <unk>
These few words <unk> a lot to me, and I didn't go back again.
When <unk> was in the hospital, and he had severe pains and severe headaches because her facial nerve was <unk> I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by my wife's face.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile, <unk> and <unk> in my face.
I'm going to be okay. Please don't <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we <unk>
I <unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist the hardest times and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any 16-year-old girl.
<unk> when you didn't run their homework.
You fight with your siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What are you special in my <unk> that has made so bold to <unk> so <unk> <unk> and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't.
I didn't cut your wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering engineering.
And I want to tell you that I recently joined the <unk> <unk> where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the Google <unk> <unk> but all the work that I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I did before I join Google or outside of my job.
And having said this, there is a stigma when you give you an operation in the brain.
You're still like intelligent or not?
It won't be like this, you'll be able to be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the dead part of the dead that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to be able to make, from more than a dozen powerful chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, they would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide to decide about combinations and <unk> and try to <unk> them to go with life.
More than one time I've been saved by little.
But luckily, I have <unk> soul for what I decided I decided to do to try and get the dose of the dose, that there really doesn't have a map of clear that tells you in <unk>
I started to test it with different <unk> and I was amazed at how small changes in the dose would dramatically dramatically change my <unk> my sense of who I was, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months and I tried a dose of typical chemical and chemical <unk> for a <unk> <unk> and I was surprised to see how I changed my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time on sex, and I thought it was the most intelligent person around the world, and --  of course, many times in the past I've met several kinds of guys like this, or maybe some versions of <unk>
It turned out as an extreme.
But my big surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a lot of <unk> to fix a problem that had in front of it, and it just wouldn't happen.
So I couldn't deal with it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation for men and what you have to do -- since I have been better with men.
What I was trying to get to the <unk> of those hormones and they neurotransmitters and so on, I was regain my intelligence after disease and <unk> my thinking creative, my flow of ideas.
I used to think of almost always in images, and that became my key point of reference. How do I get those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you get together -- new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things like this.
They thought that images and ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind.
So after several years, I get to find the point right and I've got lots of great mental <unk> mental <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take these mental images from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a film director would be able to use their imagination just to drive the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of his head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting to this with two recent experiments that were done by two groups that were leading to the two <unk>
Both of these <unk> MRI imaging imaging -- to represent the brain. You can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The one on the left is showing the scan of the brain that looks at an image.
The middle column shows the scan of the brain of that same individual as you <unk> looking at that same picture.
The column on the right was <unk> the contents of the middle column on the left. You see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between looking at an image and imagining that same picture is <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the lab of Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn the brain waves into <unk> visual fields.
So let's go back this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos, while they were <unk> their brains to create a big pool of feedback reactions from the brain to video sequence.
And then I showed you a film with new images, new people, new animals, and as well as they were <unk> a new <unk>
The computer -- using just the brain data <unk> to show what seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the computer <unk> and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This blew us up.
We are right about this.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image and when you can imagine that same image, you create in the brain the same <unk>
This was done with the open-source brain scanning systems available today, and its resolution to a thousand times a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you <unk>
There are a lot of techniques to do that.
One is open the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer for that.
Many of them are proposing new <unk> techniques to projection through images, even I have <unk> with the recent outcome of MRI -- first we need to ask the next one, this technology will be the end of the road?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get bigger resolution is with bigger magnets -- but at this point, <unk> magnets only offer small improvements in the resolution -- doesn't have increase by thousands of us as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of bigger magnets -- make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with arrangements -- slightly different -- like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI were to make really big magnets -- right?
However, most of the latest advances in <unk> of ingenious and brilliant solutions and <unk> and <unk> in the transmitter and receptors in FM systems in MRI systems.
At its time, instead of a <unk> magnetic field, they set up similar magnetic patterns attached to the frequencies of <unk> radius.
So by combining the magnetic patterns with the patterns of <unk> radio processing patterns, we can increase the information that you can extract in one single <unk>
In addition, we can then split into layers of the growing brain of the brain structure and memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood fluid, but the hormones and <unk> that I mentioned and perhaps even the neural activity directly. This is sleep.
Will we be able to put our ideas into direct digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go over the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> to use it as a tool to amplify our thought skills and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar diseases.
We have few choices to open up this door.
But anyway, choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about getting out of the closet, and not just in a traditional sense, not just the gay <unk>
I think we all have <unk>
And his closet probably is to tell some person for the first time to love it, or tell someone who gets pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other hard conversation that you have ever done in life.
And all of us can be a hard conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and have gone out of that <unk>
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked in the South Side of <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I was there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, I gave <unk> as a <unk>
And I'm going to be slope that by the <unk> of my pants and my short <unk> and I would hold my head through a little bit, I would ask you usually a kid -- "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And it would appear to be uncomfortable with the table.
I <unk> my jaw a little bit more, would take my cafe with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a cold cold to her son.
But I wouldn't say anything, and <unk> inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years -- I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that next time I would say something.
I would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence but this time I was prepared and I was about to get in the female issues at the table.  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a piece of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
So I took a deep breath, and I went down to my back and my back -- a four-year-old girl with a dress -- I looked at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: "Are you <unk> or <unk>
So I took a deep breath, and I put myself out of <unk> near it, and I said, "Hey, I know this is <unk>
I have the short hair like the one in a boy, and I have a little boy, but I'm a girl, and you know, like you like to use a <unk> and sometimes you like to use a comfortable <unk>
Well, I'm more from the kind of girl <unk>
And that girl looked at me <unk> and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and he's got a fish.
You can give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all <unk> "Ah, you're a girl.
What about <unk> <unk>
It was the very difficult conversation.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I was both of them, we were <unk> with one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, you can't know what color are the walls.
You just know how one feels living in a closet.
That's how my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
<unk> I will give you a hundred reasons why to get out of my lives, it was harder to come out of his, but this is the <unk> The hard thing is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who have declared bank banking is harder to say it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell is more difficult to tell your son of five years that you're going to <unk>
There's no more difficult, there is only the hard.
We have to stop <unk> what we have to do with respect to the other person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we should only feel empathy because we all live in a hard thing.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make security, or at least security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls are made -- a <unk> not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse tail, a dress and <unk> shoes.
I wasn't the militant <unk> to fight any four year-old boy who would walk into the coffee.
I was frozen by fear, <unk> on a corner of my dark <unk> <unk> my gay grenade -- and the moving only one muscle is the most scary thing I've ever done.
My family, my friends, full strangers with whom I've spent my entire life trying to not <unk> and now the world turned around the purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we all follow for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> you kill you.
One of my most memorable <unk> launches was in my sister.
It was the first time many of the guests were invited to be gay, and by doing my <unk> <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people who were known to me.
And after talking a moment, one of the women <unk> <unk> to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Did you ever get in the <unk>
"Well, yes, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and it's never talking about <unk>
<unk> What is your TV show.
Our <unk> Will and Will and Grace program.
And you know who we <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in trying desperately to show her support, to get me to know that I was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses <unk> <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that time, as they have all the Scud <unk>
<unk> might have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realizing the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you want.
That's how hard conversations are still not going to be my strong point.
Ask anyone that I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of Girl <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it involves getting out of any <unk> is essentially the same.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> armor. Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee had no armor but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> others must know that they also <unk>
Number two: Be <unk> <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If they say to your parents that maybe they might be gay, they will keep the hope that that could change.
Don't give them a false sense of hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex one.
You communicate your truth.
They would never be surprised by that.
And some of you can go <unk> safe, who have done, but I'm never sorry about what they are.
And yeah, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that thing in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but they don't have their own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find yourself in a dark <unk> a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you can feel it too alone, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the history of how intelligence has been seen as a productive example -- has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think is that interesting as the question of whether a submarine can <unk>
When you <unk> <unk> he wrote this as a criticism to the computer pioneers as Alan Turing Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, we <unk> a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Take a step back.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you're from an alien race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth or the Earth of the Earth no Earth's intelligence and the Earth's intelligence and you can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can look at the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know the reason we are trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know anything about it, that it doesn't have any concept about the Earth's intelligence of the Earth, you would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, to some point in time, the asteroids that <unk> the surface of a <unk> planet.
And that's why I claim this is the same question for understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I conducted several years ago, I studied a variety of issues through science, across disciplines, that I think, I think, towards a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be <unk> adjusted for the development of intelligence, and in particular, to developing states of states that <unk> the diversity of potential future.
Finally, in the <unk> planning, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so by taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I said, "Well, for several years ago, there's a mechanism underlying the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for intelligence <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're looking at is probably the equivalent of an equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence I ever seen.
So what you're looking at here is a claim that intelligence is a <unk> <unk> that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action or to keep the open choice with a force T, with the diversity of possible future <unk> Yeah, to an imminent time, <unk>
In short, the intelligence doesn't like to stay <unk>
<unk> is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and maintaining open choices.
And so having to mind this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the human intelligence level.
<unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> in their life should be more favorable to the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not correlates with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually <unk> directly from it?
To find out, we have developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy.
<unk> <unk> could spend multiple trials of animal intelligence, play games, and even earn money for <unk> actions, it all without the right thing to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> human standing here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave it to <unk> a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability of equilibrium will have applications for <unk> robotics and human care.
This ability to use tools in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, just like some other animals can cooperate to cooperate pulling on opposite sides of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can perform a version of the model of that task.
This ability of cooperation has interesting implications for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see this successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> your potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where the friends are constantly constantly being <unk> and keeps doing the <unk> network.
This same <unk> capacity of network also has applications in healthcare, in energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, and finding success and using the Panama Canal to extend to the global level in order to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense problem, and <unk> logistics and transportation.
Finally, we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and running a <unk> strategy in a simulated series of actions, and successfully increasing the assets under their cost exponentially.
This risk of risk delivery will have increased applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of intelligent human behaviors, such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation, all of us from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here's a profound <unk>
Let's go back to the beginning of the use of the <unk> <unk> play, there was always the concept that if we were smart machines, there would be an <unk> <unk>
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades -- we've had the entire concept of the rebellion -- the reverse <unk>
It's not that machines first become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all right, that the urge to take the control of all the possible future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually emerge from taking control, rather than being backwards.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
They often ask me, how is it that we look for targets <unk> from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to pass the descendants to help them build artificial <unk> or to help them understand human intelligence, is this: intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid constraints in its own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between the <unk> of stars and losing the planet we call <unk>
Even over the last few years, we've <unk> our knowledge of how it fits Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler NASA mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which is going on to the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the faint <unk> intensity when planets go ahead of them, and they burn a little bit of that light to get to us.
The data gathered on Kepler show the size of planets besides the distance that there are between them and their mother.
Together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light that they receive from their <unk>
Instead, this gives you clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this treasure of worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
<unk> was the hottest <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us for millennia, they're now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that have caused a global scale have moved through our ability to disrupt their course.
But I'm not a weather scientist, no <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as somebody very interested in the search for life in the universe -- I can tell you that the more I look for Earth-like planets like the Earth, rather than our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the first recently discovered and the planets that we know <unk> our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit farther away from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially habitable world, shown this by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we studied so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> track its surface looking for clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites like the <unk> mission take samples from the <unk> atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
<unk> companies now provide not just short space flights but also the ability to live on Mars.
But even though all of these images, we remind us the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the ideas that are <unk> and <unk> compared to Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still on <unk> places that are actually <unk> compared to Mars.
Even in the <unk> and higher places on Earth is cool and filled with oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I'm worried that this excitement for the colonization of Mars and other planets <unk> with a huge and sad planets <unk> the implication and the belief that Mars would expect there to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly <unk> Earth.
For a lot of my exploration of exploration -- I'm in deep disagreement with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to empower humanity is how to imagine that the captain of Titanic is going to take place later on the life <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for exploration <unk> and the ground preservation is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding, to preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They're just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain spaces in the hostile and <unk> areas of the ground, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
Let me leave you with a <unk> experiment.
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi Fermi said, realizing that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of the existence of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced advanced enough to consider to live between the stars, lose the notion of the important thing that is to protect the origin of planets that are <unk>
It's <unk> to think that only the colonization of the <unk> will save us ourselves, but drug preservation and <unk> exploration, can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to look at the hostile environments of Mars for the human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I <unk> my own home.
And as I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that were on the dining table where I had <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all right there.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get to, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend of Jeff <unk> I had an early flight to Europe in the next morning and my <unk>
<unk> expensive, but it's sure not more expensive than a <unk> in the night, so I thought, although despite the circumstances, there was a good stopped.
I'm a neurologist, a profession and a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> which increases the heart rate -- <unk> levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thought.
And when I arrived at <unk> <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to wonder, if there was something I could do, systems that could put on her place, which would happen to happen.
Or at least, if bad things happen, the probability that it will be a total <unk>
So I got to think about that, but until a month later my thoughts were not <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> won the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed I told him about the window, and that I had forgotten my <unk> and Danny shared shared with me that I had been practicing something called <unk> <unk>
This is something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this a few years earlier, known as <unk>
You all know what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In the <unk> like <unk> you look forward and tries to figure out all of the things that might go wrong, then you try to figure out what it can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is some things that we can do in the shape of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, it will be a place for things that are easily lost.
This sounds common sense and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track the location of the location of the important things, where the fish are right, that places the trees -- that places the <unk> trees where the tribes are living and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows you to find your nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of the <unk> and they still could find their nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move very much.
This is the reason for losing the car keys, <unk> reading and <unk>
So at home -- a place for the keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your <unk> a particular <unk>
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you take a place and be <unk> with it all of your things will always be there when the <unk>
What about <unk>
Take a picture of his credit cards, a <unk> license license of drive, <unk> <unk> mail itself to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can facilitate <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thought.
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we're not going to be at the best moment, and you have to put the systems on your site.
And there's perhaps no more stressful situation than when you're faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a personal being, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> like a <unk> for all of us taking medical decisions and actually to make financial decision decision and social decisions, any kind of decision that you need to take from a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the physician says, "I've received the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
They all know that high cholesterol cholesterol is associated with greater risk of heart disease, heart disease, <unk>
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the physician says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you've heard about the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, you even are likely to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do so, a statistic that you have to ask for which most doctors don't want to talk about, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or submit to surgery in any medical procedure before they help a person.
And you must think about what kind of statistic is <unk>
Number one must be one.
My doctor didn't give me something if he wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not a doctor, and if it's <unk> it's from scientists like me.
We haven't understood the <unk> mechanisms.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs are just about 30 percent of the people.
So the number necessary to treat the most widely <unk> what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before they help someone person?
300.
This is the research of the cynical researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> independently <unk> independently of <unk>
I <unk> the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, or cerebral <unk> or another event.
Now you might think, "Well, a chance in 300 of my <unk>
Why not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for everybody <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistic statistic -- and it is, <unk> of the <unk> effects.
For this particular drug, the side effects occur in five percent of patients.
And those include things that are <unk> <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain, <unk> pain, but now they're thinking, <unk> percent of not quite likely to happen to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
Remember that under stress don't think clearly.
So think about how you <unk> this over time, so you don't have to make the <unk> chain on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 are side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get out of the drug that will help you help your drugs.
I don't say they should not take the <unk>
I just say you must have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic is required, is part of the principle of informed consent.
We have access to these kinds of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take care or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number you need to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that you do in men over 50 percent of 50 percent of the prostate cancer, the number you need to treat is <unk>
This is 49 surgeries by a person who has helped.
And the side effects in that case are produced in 50 percent of patients.
Those include the helplessness or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can propose to bring the conversation forward.
You don't have to do this stuff on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have an option many times, you want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain at the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change from opinion in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that a bunch of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
<unk> face with a predator, is not necessary to be the <unk> system, or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending the metabolism in those things, it's not moving very quickly. You might be <unk> you might be <unk>
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those stress moments is the rational sense, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to <unk> to think about the future of these kinds of situations.
I think what's important here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail in a while.
The idea is to think about the future as those <unk> to put systems in the place that will be able to minimize damage, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
<unk> on the night of snow in Montreal when I returned from my journey, my contractor set up a combination of combination along with the door, with a key on the door with a key to the entry door in the same way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I haven't <unk> and lots of text messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not <unk> but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite musical symbol.
It means <unk> <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play <unk>
Two <unk> even <unk>
Four <unk> extremely smoothly.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> may -- I will never make a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The language of French signs came over the 1970s, and over the time, he mixed with local signs, and developed the language that we currently know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and they taught me to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I believed it was true.
However, I realize that it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, you're really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world, is like I lived in a foreign country, following their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand the sound <unk>
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people answers.
So I've learned this for example.
"Not <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag of chips in <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, sure don't <unk> the <unk>
All of this is what I call <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound label over what the average person does it.
I'm so <unk> <unk>
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is for coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk>
<unk> to continue.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that <unk> doesn't have notes on the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the <unk> subtle and <unk>
In <unk> culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do the mind with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines on the paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an art residence there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that moment, the sound was the trend and that was called <unk>
There was no visual art, it was all <unk>
Now sound has come into my territory of art.
Will I get more about art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that you don't just experience through the ears.
I can feel it a <unk> or really experience it visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the property of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything that had been taught in the sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I introduced it to the art community, he was <unk> with the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power -- the <unk> a social currency.
In the background of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was a kind of a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that I might be able to <unk> me and my artistic job, or I might be <unk>
I chose to be <unk>
There's a massive culture around the speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like if I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me equal and become my voice.
So I'm capable of being relevant in today's society.
So in school, in work and institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> their voices, I am able to keep a time temporary value form like taking a loan with a very high interest rate.
If I won't continue with this practice, I feel that it could be <unk> in the <unk> and not having any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium -- <unk> in the music world.
And I was amazed at the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot capture and express fully on the paper.
And the same can tell you about a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and they're highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much as the sound of the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you understand better how the <unk> works.
So imagine a piano.
<unk> divide into a lot of different <unk>
If we <unk> a different parameter for every finger while you get the piano, like facial expression, the movement, the speed, the shape of hand and so, while the piano, English is a linear language, like <unk> just a step at the time.
However, the <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in the way to express a very clear concept or an idea of <unk>
If only one key would change the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens to the music as a tone, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> using these different parameters -- you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal is <unk> in that."
This is the signal <unk> in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> <unk>
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see the <unk> through the lenses of music?
If I had to create a sign and get it back over and again, it could become like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and you put it.
This is every day."
If you <unk> it and you get the speed, visually look like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same can be said to you. I think the same thing.
All right.
This is all night.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> I <unk>
I feel the third one has more <unk> than the other two.
This is how you express time in <unk> and how the distance the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one that is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at once, <unk> over again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rhythm of four times per <unk>
However, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically it will automatically be <unk>
Look at <unk> right hand. <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through your head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Can you do with me?
All the hands of the hands on top.
Now we're going to do it both in my head like the chest, and something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yes, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and the languages of signs around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this. Please do it again.
And now this is this.
It means <unk> in <unk>
Now, the third. Please <unk> again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and the chest but they get very different meanings themselves.
It's amazing to see how <unk> is alive and <unk> as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> has no sound automatically has no social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to grow its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn <unk> I don't have to hear to learn music.
<unk> is a treasure trove trove -- and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I would like to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience from our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents said, "Can you <unk> everything, but then you have to <unk>
<unk> involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a <unk> bubble or a bubble of ignorance I should say, because the adults would lie to us to protect us from the awful truth.
When I got older, I found that the adults also <unk> and that they're not very good to clean the other of the other.
The country is now an adult and teach citizen and invention in the <unk> school of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait so much for my students to walk through the beach with lots of waste.
So as the citizens, we cleaned the beaches, and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but today more than 80 percent of the ocean contain plastic.
It's a little bit creepy.
And in the last decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, and we networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also so risky to use those huge <unk>
So along with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dream about invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> <unk> work so that children very <unk> can also participate.
And I'll tell you, the kids who manipulate electrical tools feel great and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and we reduce it the size we find in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
We do.
I leave my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to figure out something that we hope to work.
We decided instead of collecting chunks of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we took an image of this <unk> the children are <unk> a lot with robots.
And then we quickly create what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast in the creation of prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we turn on light bulbs and web cameras and <unk> in a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and by the plastic we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the bits of plastic floating through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of every single <unk> to get a estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this kind of step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would save it even more.
The cool thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to try to solve it immediately.
<unk> researching my favorite problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very well <unk>
Do you see the news, they see the Internet, and it was <unk> with this <unk>
A child, maybe less than 10 years, cleaning a oil spill, just using the hands, in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that you drink is the water that they <unk> the water where they <unk> the place where they live.
You can also see that water is brown, the mud and oil are also <unk> and when it's all <unk> it's very difficult to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> that can <unk> through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help to identify what's in the water.
We <unk> this prototype with a sensor and we sent it to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I was forced to investigate a problem of <unk> I was forced to make a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further, maybe maybe to address a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I am half Japanese and French half and maybe remember, in 2011, there was an devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it started several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> there are several cities on the coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant from Fukushima, a nuclear station close to water.
And today, according to the reports about 300 tons still <unk> of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure <unk> radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared disappeared from the coast coast -- and most of them -- of course, is safe, it's blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the accident and performed independently with other scientists, the land, and we wanted to take the children.
Of course I don't <unk> the parents don't <unk>
But every night we <unk> at the center of the <unk> here is the use of different masks here.
It might seem like they didn't take work seriously, but they did this because they're going to have to live with the <unk> their whole life.
Together with them we discussed the data <unk> that day and we talked about what we were going to do afterwards, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> <unk> to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
We were able to notice that the radioactive powder is <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But based on this we organized an civil expedition -- the nearest nuclear expedition to date.
We get closer to a half miles away from the nuclear cell, and with the fishermen of the <unk> we were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a <unk> <unk> as we did and built and built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it has been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage that we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became slightly small so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turned it into the largest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong -- and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, of manipulating basically, can you build almost entirely there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can become reality with the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
Students: <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or can we help in the mobility of the old age of transforming their standard wheels into new vehicles in new vehicles.
The plastic, the oil and oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our kids are lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So as a scientific scientist, we have <unk> we need to make the next generation to care about the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two radically opposite design.
One is made out of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of the single dragline silk.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
One is imposes on the environment, the other one believed it.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that struggle for being free.
The <unk> was a <unk> tool.
But living things are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we took all the information to take it for every cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and production in mass.
The assembly lines have <unk> a world made of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and trained architects to think of their objects as <unk> of different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back is <unk> thick with little <unk>
You are acting primarily like <unk> the other mostly like barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there's no parts, no <unk>
It's a system that vary gradually its functionality through <unk> variation.
Here's a divided screen that represents my vision of the world -- the <unk> personality personality and architect to work at the time between the <unk> and the gene between the machine, and the organism, between the assembly and the growth, between the assembly and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and right, analysis, and synthetic shows on the two screens behind me.
My job at the simplest level, it tries to bring these two visions of the world, moving away from the assembly and approaching growth.
You're probably asking you why now?
Why wasn't it possible for this 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where I <unk> four disciplines that offers access to tools that we never had access to the tools we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please meet the minds and my hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools through large-scale scales, like this <unk> robotic arm with a scope of 24 meters in diameter with a <unk> base that some day, not very far to print up buildings and graphics and <unk> <unk>
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and it has created a screen where every aperture is in size size to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> This was for a fashion fashion fashion fashion fashion fashion fashion fashion fashion fashion fashion fashion fashion fashion fashion fashion fashion fashion fashion <unk>
Together with 3D printing <unk> we print this layer and <unk> 3D <unk> between the cells, I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid and soft materials at the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
Is it also the resolution of a <unk> scanner.
That designers have access to this high-resolution resolution and <unk> instruments allow us to design products that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed an acoustic chair, a chair to the comfortable and the comfortable and also it absorbs sound.
The Carter professor, my collaborator, went back to nature to <unk> and by designing this <unk> surface pattern, it becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
Its surface, like in nature, changes its functionality not through the addition of other material or another <unk> but continuously <unk> the material property.
But it's nature <unk>
There's no parts in nature?
I was not raised in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me the stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them was stuck with me and came to define a lot of what it matters.
Like she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> tree <unk>
For that first tree -- there would be no difference between trunk, picking up leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the land made up trees with <unk> <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The Earth created a world made of place.
I often ask myself, "What would design if objects did of a single deal.
<unk> a better state of the <unk>
So we look for the <unk> material -- the kind of material of the tree <unk> with fruit and we found it.
The second <unk> <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons produced every year by organisms like shrimp, or <unk> and <unk>
We thought that if we could tune your property, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> <unk>  <unk> a lot of <unk> of <unk> the <unk> and we produced <unk>
<unk> chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to the soft light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures -- this is built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could change the properties of material on the march and create these structures made of one <unk> material, 100 percent recyclable material.
When the pieces are ready, you let it dry it up to find a natural way to contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process was used to contain <unk> <unk> which first appeared on the planet <unk> billion years ago, like we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria designed to capture rapidly of the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition from without <unk> <unk> and if it spread even closer, on the window.
A <unk> tree <unk>
Working with an old material, one of the first life forms on the planet, with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure of <unk> of shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best part: for objects for <unk> in the sea, <unk> the <unk> and put it on the ground, they'll help grow a tree.
The <unk> for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we need to master bacteria and control their flow.
Just like the <unk> table we did our own table of items, new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology like <unk> liquid -- just rather than <unk> metals -- <unk> <unk> new biological <unk> inside very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these genetically engineered crops.
In our first piece of clothes, <unk> two <unk> <unk>
The first one is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and the <unk> fresh water.
And the second E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human <unk>
One makes light in sugar, the other use sugar and produces biofuels to the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that looks like <unk> tract that will help us <unk> these bacteria and to make their way out.
So we started making those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material according to <unk>
If we wanted more photosynthesis, we get more transparent.
This <unk> system <unk> when it stretch from one end to another, <unk> 60 feet.
This is half the length of a soccer field, and 10 times our gut <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels in your clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are earlier creatures, that only half is <unk>
What if design <unk> the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase <unk> matter.
And if we could create personal <unk> that we <unk> our skin, <unk> tissue <unk> and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of editing the biology.
I call this the material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
For now, you know that a 3D printer prints material into layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do it that way.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates highly sophisticated architecture -- a home within which they were <unk>
<unk> <unk> is about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of not two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, putting those fibers into each other.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm will first turn into the environment, create a <unk> structure and then starts <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, attach a small magnet to the head of a worm worm to <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of cocoon of cocoon of <unk>
However, when you put the silk worm into a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that they would <unk> a blueprint and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different <unk> different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape -- the composition, the structure of the <unk> is driven directly by the environment.
It's often <unk> silk worms to death inside their <unk> their silk <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates -- we can shape <unk> <unk> without boiling one <unk>
It was <unk> and we could create these things.
So we actually captured this process to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making templates <unk> and we put ourselves on our site.
We knew that silk worms are going to go into the most dark and most dark areas of that, so we use a street diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the rays from light and heat, <unk> the silk worms about structure.
We were ready to get the <unk>
<unk> <unk> silk worms to a online farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully at the bottom of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> they put eggs, and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the big integrity, and he was right.
And by <unk> biological silk on the <unk> <unk> <unk> the entire pavilion and our integrity.
And in a little over two or three weeks, <unk> silk worms, <unk> miles away.
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions in the world.
A <unk> silk is through a robotic arm, the other one full empty.
If the last frontier of design is to give rise to the products and the buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, designers need to bring these two visions of the world.
Which leads us to turn, of course, at the beginning.
So here is a new era of design, a new era of creation, which takes us from a inspired design in nature to a nature inspired by us, for the first time, that we take care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you ever asked them, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they were asked when they asked them for the first time.
You can do it with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It's caused by some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem was not that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In the school I liked English, the <unk> and the art and the art and the web was playing the guitar in a rock band called <unk> <unk>
You may have heard of us.
And I usually like to try and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this feeling of organic, this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to give it back.
But then I was fascinated by something else, something completely different, and I would focus on it, and I'm going to let me absorb and feel <unk> I found <unk> and then again this point where I start <unk>
And finally, I want to give it again.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this whole thing into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, denying all of my other passions and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little more personal.
I was worried that there would be something wrong with this, and something wrong with me not <unk> at all.
I was worried about being afraid of engagement, or being dispersed, or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I'd like to ask you something I would like to ask you back then.
Ask yourself, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they <unk> they learned it.
And we ask ourselves, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that no one matters what they were going to be at that age.
It's considered a naive question to create nice answers in the kids like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or want to be <unk>
I <unk> the <unk> of <unk> here.
So this question goes us over and over again as we grow in various ways, <unk> high school students asked them to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It's about being the cute exercise of before what the sleep takes us.
Why?
If this question inspire kids to dream with what might be, don't inspire to dream with everything that might be.
In fact, it does the opposite.
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  And he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor would turn into <unk> <unk> teacher and creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that each of us has something to do during your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected in this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that take their curiosity and lots of different things that want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feeling something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with many interests and creative activities.
It's a breath, so he said.
It could help if you divide in three other multiple and potential multiple <unk>
You can also use the other terms that we <unk> the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was who was okay with multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any term that you like or <unk> you know.
It seems to me as a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like limitation or <unk> you must win.
But what I've learned by talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths to be in this way.
Here are three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the <unk>
We <unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests on cartography, visualization of data, travel mathematics and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates <unk> <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this idea by his <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
And this comes from new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their background can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower superpower is going to be fast.
When we <unk> them -- we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to be <unk> because it's been so many times in the past, and this means we have less fear of testing new things and out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring all of what we've learned to every new area that we have, so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a complete full-time <unk> and independent <unk>
As a young pianist, an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest known <unk>
Before I become a writer, <unk> was a financial <unk>
He had to learn the fine sales mechanics when they first started their practices and this ability to write compelling incentives for the editors.
It is rarely a loss of time to go to what you would expect, even if at the end of the end, you will.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you couldn't have <unk>
The third superpower superpower is adaptability. I mean, the ability to transform into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the director of videos, other web designer -- sometimes a sign of Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and, sometimes, James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take diverse roles depending on your clients.
<unk> Company defines adaptability as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can <unk> to meet the needs of the market, the ones that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills you could lose if they're <unk> to reduce their targets.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> your belly knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams make up a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep and put in practice ideas, and <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are connected to the way we're connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> most of them are <unk> to be just more like their fellow <unk>
Once I said this, if there is one thing that you can take from this talk, I hope it is this: <unk> with internal <unk> whatever it is.
If you are a heart specialist, then you <unk> for all the media.
That's where you give the best of it.
But for <unk> in the room, including those of you who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,   I say, <unk> with their many passions.
Keep their curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
<unk> our inner <unk> it takes us to a more authentic life and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, we <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In <unk> to a woman called <unk> they took a psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember the most basic details of your life.
Her doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until unfortunately, passed away.
After his death, <unk> did a look and they found metal plates and <unk> in the <unk> brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The more amazing thing.
If you could have been living today, we couldn't give her the people more aid than he <unk> gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
We've discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the infections, many treatments for cancer <unk> to HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But recently it's made progress on Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for over a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million which, by the way, include many of you.
If you wait to live to 85 years or more, the chance of Alzheimer's Alzheimer's will be almost one of the two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that you spend their <unk> years with Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or have Alzheimer's disease.
Already in the United States, health care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare is spending disease disease.
Today is the most expensive disease and its costs -- an increase of five times by 2050, as the generation of the <unk> <unk>
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's disease is one of the biggest medical and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot be allowed to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less Alzheimer's disease than other diseases because we spend less time and money in the research.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than Alzheimer's cancer in spite of the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a cause more fundamental causes of consciousness.
Because this is what people knows, but the whole world <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years, all of us, all of the last <unk> -- all of them, even the scientists, have Alzheimer's Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you just look at a picture of a healthy brain in comparison with one of the Alzheimer's patient to see the actual physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to restore a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's brain significantly life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules today.
You can think of a protein molecule as a piece of paper that folds up as an origami.
There are places in paper that are <unk>
And when it folds out, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> dots stay outside.
So this makes the molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University, trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of which step is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb explode.
You have to find the right step that we would do, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, most of the wires have been reduced and waited for the best.
But now there are a diverse group of people, doctors, the biologists, the <unk> the physicists, engineers, engineers and engineers.
And together, we've been able to identify a critical step in the process. Now we're testing a new kind of drugs that are testing specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our last results.
Nobody outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at some videos of what happened when we test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move with normal.
These worms -- on the other hand, have molecules of protein that stick with each other inside of them, like Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms in a early stage, then we see that <unk> and they live a normal life.
This is just a positive outcome, but research like this sample that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there is real hope of what it can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But so that I grow that hope, of overcoming Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not scientists like me, it's about you.
We must <unk> that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we can do it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure of governments, drug industry and <unk>
That was essential to move into the treatment of HIV in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to defeat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't speak for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones and night, are often too <unk> to come out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> talking to them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
I <unk> this article in the New York Times column, in January of this year.
In love with someone, I do this.
The paper is about a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and my own experience when I test it myself a night last summer.
So the procedure is pretty simple: Two strangers are <unk> to become 36 more and more personal questions and then both of you look at your eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple questions.
Number one: If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, which would be?
Number one: When was the last time you would ask another person person?
And <unk>
The <unk> <unk> are increasingly personal.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me to tell your partner what you like about him or her, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to someone you've just met.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a detail really struck me, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later, and invited to the whole lab to the <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making a romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had the occasion to test this study, with someone who I knew not particularly good, I didn't expect to be <unk>
However, we got <unk> and I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the <unk>
That was published in January, and now it's <unk> so I guess some of you are probably wondering: they are going to be <unk>
And the reason I think they challenge this is because I've done this question over and over again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before the article was published, I was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had been told to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog input can come to a few hundred views as a lot, and those were usually just from my friends from Facebook and imagined that my article in the New York Times would take a few thousand of the seen.
And that was a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But he had no idea.
The paper was put on a Friday at night, and already Saturday, this happened on the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday already had been called <unk> Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the paper got over eight million pages, and I was like, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to boost the confidence writing <unk> about <unk> experiences, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, they were doing the first question: I still ask the same question: I still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search in my email with the phrase: <unk> <unk> <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were students and journalists and <unk> <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately put in red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in a international basis, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to be <unk> their own.
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for San <unk> that included the experiences of readers when we test the study in different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all of this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not every request that we both asked to do a public present together.
<unk> TV interviews, and <unk> <unk> requests for us two.
I think I was afraid to become the <unk> icons of the process of <unk> a range for which I didn't feel at absolute <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know just if the study worked -- they wanted to know if they really <unk> I mean, if I was able to make love <unk> not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question that I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months and I felt, mostly that people made the wrong question.
How do you know if we were going together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not to produce Romantic love.
Instead, I was looking at <unk> <unk> between university students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
Participants were found closer after doing that, several later studies, they also used the protocol <unk> <unk> <unk> as a quick way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it among members of the police and the community -- and they used it among people with <unk> political argument.
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this paper, but unfortunately never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and said to me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, Do you want to say that the person who is <unk>
Well he did a <unk>
I think she just wants us to be friends.
I said, but became better friends?
<unk> they were able to get better best after testing the <unk>
<unk>
So, I said.
However, I don't think that that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled upon the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult <unk>
I had had that relationship since I had 20, which was most of my adult life, and he was my first true love, and I had no idea how or I could live without it.
So I was focusing on science.
So I did all of what I could find on the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could sort of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I just <unk> for the book that I wrote -- but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought if I was built with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and I used to feel like I sat then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one way or another way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what you <unk>
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I look for is sometimes more than reasonably <unk>
What I look for love is a <unk> not just being <unk> today and being <unk> but I'm going to continue to be <unk> by the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know if they were still together.
The story that the media told about the 36 questions is that there can be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to somehow mitigate some of the risk of <unk> and this is a very <unk> story, because in love it makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that I say, still follow together?
And their content with an answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question, I would submit to ask questions more difficult, questions like, how do you decide who your love deserves and who isn't it?
How to stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live in uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how you live in the question of your <unk>
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good start to have a <unk> conversation, about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, is <unk> a year ago, a known year, and I apply a study designed to create romantic love, we <unk> ourselves -- and I'm very <unk>
But in love in love -- it's not the same as to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my <unk> article -- love didn't happen.
<unk> <unk> because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit to read it now, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, there was no thought of everything that was supposed to be.
I didn't think about how many times we would have both to take that decision, and how much times I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always choose or not.
I want you to be enough to have done and responded questions, 36 questions, I chose to love somebody as generous, kind and fun and <unk> that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, in change, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't think of truth.
And what I <unk> and what maybe I'll spend my life searching for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending to implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I actually did not <unk>
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love someone, and the hope that he would also love, and it's frightening, but that's a deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a couple of <unk> and in a way, I came like a <unk> of the forest.
The city of New York does a time.  One thing that really affected me but more details that really affected me.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box and <unk> a dollar bill for a dollar, a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some weird <unk> or a space of aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas -- for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has <unk> because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a moment, I was in <unk> <unk> like going out of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and all these things <unk> and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took it all the pages and I took a kind of <unk> I was <unk> by the style of Agnes <unk> the <unk> <unk> and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother has scared to the bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking I could <unk>
Instead, it happened to the opposite of it -- somehow it seemed to grow up, as if it was to <unk> the text with a <unk>
So I did -- I built more boxes.
This time, I started to add a electronic elements, frogs, <unk> bottles that I was finding out the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God of mine can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> draw like a body of a body in the crime scene.
And I pulled out objects and created my own taxonomy of individuals who were <unk>
First, <unk> that you can get an idea.
Then I made insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning a little bit of money, to bring my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I became interested in human form -- sculptures of human size with drawings of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass, similar to drawing on a window, and then on another window and another window, and I had all these windows together that make a three-dimensional composition there.
And this really works, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big, that I call <unk>
For <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
<unk> feet long.
It has double faces, so it's 10 feet of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
The left on the left, is Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with heads of animals travel between two worlds.
They're going from the world of representation, to this <unk> <unk> <unk> where it <unk>
This is where creatures with animals with animals are headed to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a black God tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand is coming clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems to be the <unk> that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's one aspect of the <unk>
It's a little story.
That's the hand that I <unk>
And then, when you go on the other hand, it has a <unk> like a bird <unk> and it spits out clouds from this <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> a long line of snake that joins the <unk>
Anyway, their tail turn on fire to <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why I did that.
Things that make you know.
Their tail ends up in a eyeball of <unk> which is made of terrorist cards, 1986.
You've got them <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards from terrorists.
All right.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a <unk> project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each is a archive of our culture, through media and material to be <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each of you acts as a kind of archive in the form of being human, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at once.
They're like cells, they come together, they're <unk>
And you can walk between them. I'm getting years old.
Each one is basically a <unk> <unk> that weighs 10,000 pounds of a human being trapped inside.
This has a small cave in my chest.
That's the <unk> the chest. You can get the entrance out there.
I'm going to share with you for the rest of the body, there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and you cover your penis or <unk> or whatever you have, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick primer on these works because I can't play it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a game in half.
This has two heads and is communicating between the two.
There are some pills coming out and enter the head of this strange <unk>
There's a little forest hall inside the cavity <unk>
Can you <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my final box.
It's a brick. It's called <unk> <unk>
Inside this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician -- a writer, a <unk> a <unk> a school, a school arm that spreads all the content that <unk> all the content we do in the world and a garden.
It <unk> the box and all the people of inside hits each other as particles.
And I think that's the way we change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that it's living in.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, of the borders, of religion, does not work.
We're all very facts from the same stuff and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when you hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But so this pill has effect against the pain of the <unk> the <unk> and other organs.
And I'll take a pill -- it's the most effective and <unk> system for any risk of any risk of the body in the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take drugs that are <unk> these serve the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the liver cells.
But they are also known for its <unk> side effects in its own negative, because in the time it takes to get to the current current and get worse and worse even for the time it takes to get to their destiny, which is where it's more important to the <unk>
These are regions of the body like the <unk> <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't go into the blood <unk> of patients who are <unk> into regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of the treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the big problem of HIV treatment with the drugs that are given a treatment for life to run <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, "How did you get the treatment directly to the <unk> of the virus, without the risk of <unk> of the <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me, <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for wounds and wounds and diabetes surgery you can be used for anything <unk> including drug transportation.
In fact, we're using laser pulses to open or drill extremely small holes that open and close the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people are asking, "How is that <unk>
We send a small and powerful laser beam over the cell membrane in HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser cuts through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of <unk>
Before you even notice, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this in <unk> technology or <unk> <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll do a <unk> in the flu site.
The second head, which is a camera, it's driving the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> which distributes the drug, it frees it directly into the site of infection, while the laser uses again to keep open cells.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if you succeed, this technology can lead to the eradication of HIV from the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of every single researcher of <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups, not <unk> criminal organizations like terrorists, or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not shoot 'n.
My goal is to understand better to these police officers in violence and study ways of encouraging the transition from violent participation to non-violent <unk>
I do work work, in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost all conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between the states and actors.
For instance, of <unk> peace agreements, between 1975 and 2011, <unk> signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we even have to <unk> or <unk> in any resolution of successful conflict.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do it, but no one analyzes what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and political policies are <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
<unk> groups are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for its violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political game, a social services network and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian <unk> known for its suicide bombers against Israel, also runs the Bank in Gaza since 2007.
So these groups do more than just shooting.
<unk>
We <unk> a complex machinery of <unk> air stations, TV channels on TV web websites and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the print <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
The armed groups are also investing in a complex fundraising <unk> but through business <unk> for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, to increase their funds, to recruit to build their brand.
<unk> groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools -- they run hospitals, they put hospitals, they put their professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all these services and more.
<unk> groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state of no security and protection.
The ascent of the Taliban in an Afghanistan <unk> in the war or even the beginning of the ascent of <unk> can also understand the efforts of these groups for delivering safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a lower price price for the population.
But in general, providing social services that means filling an empty gap by the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the electoral victory of 2006 from 2006, Palestinian Hamas cannot be able to recognize the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage, even in the West, when we look at <unk> groups, we just think of the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are hybrid people.
<unk> because they fill <unk> gaps by government, and they come up as armed and political groups, participate in violent struggle and governance.
And the more complex and the sophisticated things are these organizations, less we can <unk> as something contrary to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a territory -- you run all its <unk> collect the trash -- you run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nation without state and hybrids and the weaker the states are states, like in the Middle East today, and they fill that gap -- the actors.
This is important to governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in state tools not military tools.
It has to be in the center of government that has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
If we better understand groups -- we understand better what incentive incentives to foster the transition from violence to not violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors -- <unk> military power can win some battles, but we won't give us peace or stability.
In order to achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that safety vacuum -- to fill that <unk> of government that enabled these groups to thrive in a beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but afraid that will accept openly the label <unk> would be unfair for <unk>
I'm <unk> but quite bad.
And so I would think of it as a bad feminist feminist.
Or, at least, I wrote a paper and a book called "The <unk> and then on interviews -- people started to call me <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself and a <unk> <unk> has become a little bigger.
Let me give you one step back.
When I was a young boy, especially in my youth and the age of 20 years, I had strange ideas about <unk> these women are <unk> <unk> with the men and who <unk> sex. Like if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated all around the world and anger, in particular, it seems a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> that could be feminist <unk>
It will be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and ugly.
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, who asked too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe it is equal or <unk>
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until he realizes that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I grew up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and moreover, I would be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same wages for the same job.
We have a right to travel around the world as <unk> free or violence.
We have a right to use it easy and accessible the contraceptives and the <unk> services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without needing <unk> or doctrines to <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you need to have our other <unk>
We are not only women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> <unk> and more and much more.
We need to have these differences and how we care about the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is not anything.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear, I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist issue.
I have another confession.
When I went to work, I hear rap music <unk> all volume.
Although the letter degrades women and deeply offends me -- the classic <unk> <unk> of the Yin yang <unk> is amazing.
Do you actually have your t-shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical thinking.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I want to do -- <unk> -- all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the <unk> of trash, the <unk> and <unk> maintenance and <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> of fashion magazines and nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have fantasies <unk> of the fairy tales that come true.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, it's her choice, and I'm not who to <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise their children, I accepted that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable in this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
<unk> this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism thing that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of color women in color, gay and <unk> for <unk> white, <unk> and high school.
Listen, if that's true feminism is a very bad feminist <unk>
It also happens as this: As <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to <unk> <unk> <unk>
We hope that we're going to be right.
When we <unk> them with a lot of taste of the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I think I think about that <unk> before I try to put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yeah, I'm <unk> by fear of what that <unk> is afraid of fear not to be able to pursue the <unk>
Let's take <unk> or like I call it, <unk>
In the last few years it's a feminist <unk>
In <unk> Music <unk> in 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show and see this star star embracing feminism and to know women and young men who will be feminist and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, the critical critics started endless debates if they were <unk> it was whether or not exactly a feminist story.
We understood their feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we need a lot, we need a lot, we need a lot of things that we need a lot.
We go much beyond a sane criticism and <unk> to <unk> Feminism from any woman, <unk> until there is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> <unk> or more good, <unk> more inclusive <unk>
But what happens next?
We went to recognize our <unk> to give you the action and be a little bit <unk>
If I hear <unk> music, I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to deliver a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until we <unk> change affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why has his music to be so <unk>
It's hard to pick up something better and so easy to justify an worst choice.
But when bad decisions were justify that it makes it harder for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> of three and four years.
It's two little <unk> <unk> and <unk> and also very brave. I want you to grow in a world.
And they were <unk> by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice would be <unk> as a much easier thing to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is treating sexual violence against women like sport, <unk> the <unk> play.
We can change the radio <unk> when we hear songs that treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when movies don't treat women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting sports sports where athletes treat their partners as <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to post in your magazine, to participate in your project, or work with you, and work with you, until it doesn't have a number enough of women, so much to participate in how to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people.
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in this kind of projects, we can also encourage them to be including even more as we are <unk> to overcome the barriers to the decision jobs.
Because we're not <unk> Without these efforts, without adopt these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these little <unk> acts of bravery and hope that our decisions will get to the top, to people in the power directors and producers of film and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a durable durable change.
We can also tell the courage to our feminism, -- well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist in <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I tell you, especially because the old voice was stolen to me, and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to address what happened.
A few kids would tell me when I was too young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated like anything.
I started to believe it was nothing.
I <unk> my voice, and after all I did not bother believing something that could matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I was focusing on a stronger version of myself.
The words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and they understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that it wasn't anything.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through the script and feminism, I also found that if I was a bit brave, another woman could be <unk> and see me and see that none of us is nothing that the world tries to tell us we are.
In one hand, I have the power to do anything.
And on the other, I hold the <unk> reality that I am just a woman.
I'm a <unk> <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a bit courageous, when you need such a <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had been measles by having visited <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that measles is that measles can be terrible for a child with an immune system -- is one of the most easily connected diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for over half a century ago, but many of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak.
But a moment, was not the article that unleashed controversial about autism and vaccines and <unk> and marked by being a <unk> fraud by the British Medical Center.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that have theory that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents all over the world keep <unk> that vaccines will be endangered their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of the autism rising in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and <unk> who had heard about her to do a whole professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates were limited as only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> of fundraising as <unk> <unk> are routinely referred to autism as an epidemic, as if I could <unk> from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If it's not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people at the Centers for Disease Control of Atlanta -- what's going on, tend to be based on phrases like <unk> or <unk> <unk> and "a better detection detection to explain these <unk> numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother looking for the face of her son of two years, the visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to <unk> why they were so <unk> at the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so difficult to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with the slow, slow progress of science than with the <unk> power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global health health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we got here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a child <unk> Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital, in <unk> <unk> published an article that described 11 young patients who looked like <unk> a private <unk> <unk> people around them, even their own parents.
They could have fun for hours to waving their hands on their faces, but they were prey to panic by <unk> as when he didn't put their favorite toy in her usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
In the 1950s, as a major authority of the world on the subject, I declared seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as we were <unk> from places as far as South Africa.
This is not wonder, because the <unk> criteria for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis to children with <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he was <unk> that he had turned to nine percent every 10 children sent for other doctors to her doctor's office, without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of child <unk> caused by cold parents, <unk>
These children, he said, they kept very carefully in a fridge you don't know.
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of her young patients had special skills that they cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I turned the two years.
When her mother put one of his favorite records he put one of his favorite records he said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills affirming things like the kids were simply <unk> what they heard their parents would fail to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source for the families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
<unk> not until the 1970s that researchers started testing the theory of <unk> that autism was rare.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the theory of <unk> mothers from <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband and her husband was warm and warm and <unk> and they had a <unk> autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a little girl as Israel <unk> without special education, no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To stand up to the National Service, they needed more resources for the autistic kids, and their families, and their colleague, Judith Gould decided to do something that should be done 30 years before.
They launched a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
<unk> a suburb from London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What they saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> on their fascination for astrophysics, to dinosaurs or <unk>
Otherwise, these kids didn't fit into <unk> <unk> and <unk> as <unk> said <unk> and saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost in trying to make sense of his data.
How no one had been <unk> of these kids before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to a paper published in <unk> the next year to the article in <unk> and then <unk> buried under the cinders of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but he avoided <unk> <unk> on its own work.
There was not even an English translation but luckily, the <unk> husband was German, and he was translated for her.
The paper offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a integrated clinic with a school for Vienna in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for the teaching of children with learning <unk> were <unk> even for <unk> standards.
The morning in their clinic started with music exercises with music, and the kids kept their games on <unk>
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as disability <unk> of life that required <unk> forms of support and spaces <unk> over the course of all life.
Instead of treating the kids in their clinic as patients, Asperger's he called her little teachers, and he got to help in the development of education methods that were especially right for them.
<unk> <unk> saw autism as a diverse range that included an amazing variety of <unk> and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common, and they've always been, looking at aspects of this continuum in theoretical <unk> as the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even saying that for success in science and art, an ounce of autism is critical.
<unk> and Judith discovered that <unk> was wrong when autism was <unk> as well as parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the 1980s and the early '90s, their changes enter into <unk> by the limited model of <unk> by a broad and <unk> model.
These changes don't fell into broken <unk>
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked between <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see an adult adult for the first time.
Before he came out, <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> for experts who knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> recognition <unk> <unk> and <unk> recognition of <unk> <unk> psychologists, and parents all over the world knew what that was autism.
At the same time, they introduced the early clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I shouldn't have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for her son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes on the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm from the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started to <unk> the same as predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact waiting for the people with autism, and their families finally <unk> the support and services that were <unk>
So Andrew <unk> got to blame vaccines for the increase in <unk> and a simple, powerful <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of prevention that one in 68 children in America are in the spectrum, the <unk> are one of the world's largest groups in the world.
Over the last few years, autistic people have joined the Internet to refuse the idea that are puzzles for new breakthroughs -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think of terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work, it doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a attention attention to the details.
Without doubt people have a hard time to live in a world that's not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> that I believed that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are in the understanding of teachers, employers who have capacity, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman called <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of <unk>
As you go into an uncertain future, we need all forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
